"Visual Studio requires a solution file to work on a project. While Godot "
"does not come with the solution file, it can be generated using SCons."

"Navigate to the Godot root folder and open a Command Prompt or PowerShell "
"window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run ``scons platform=windows vsproj=yes dev_build=yes`` to generate the "
"solution with debug symbols."

"The ``vsproj`` parameter signals that you want Visual Studio solution "
"generated."

msgid ""
"The ``dev_build`` parameter makes sure the debug symbols are included, "
"allowing to e.g. step through code using breakpoints."

"You can now open the project by double-clicking on the ``godot.sln`` in the "

msgid ""
"Visual Studio features a powerful debugger. This allows the user to examine "
"Godot's source code, stop at specific points in the code, inspect the "
"current execution context, and make live changes to the codebase."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can launch the project with the debugger attached using the **Debug > "
"Start Debugging** option from the top menu. However, unless you want to "
"debug the Project Manager specifically, you'd need to configure debugging "
"options first. This is due to the fact that when the Godot Project Manager "
"opens a project, the initial process is terminated and the debugger gets "
"detached."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To configure the launch options to use with the debugger use **Project > "
"Properties** from the top menu:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open the **Debugging** section and under **Command Arguments** add two new "
"arguments: the ``-e`` flag opens the editor instead of the Project Manager, "
"and the ``--path`` argument tells the executable to open the specified "
"project (must be provided as an *absolute* path to the project root, not the "
"``project.godot`` file; if the path contains spaces be sure to pass it "
"inside double quotation marks)."
