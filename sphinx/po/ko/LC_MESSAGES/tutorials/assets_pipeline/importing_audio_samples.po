msgid ""
"WAV files use raw data or light compression (IMA-ADPCM). They are "
"lightweight on the CPU to play back (hundreds of simultaneous voices in this "
"format are fine). The downside is that they take up a lot of disk space."

"Wav 파일은 압축되지 않은 데이터나 가벼운 압축을 사용합니다 (IMA-ADPCM). 재생"
"에 CPU를 거의 사용하지 않습니다. (수 백 개의 목소리가 이 포맷으로 재생되어도 "
"문제가 없습니다), 하지만 큰 용량이 단점입니다."

msgid ""
"Ogg Vorbis files use a stronger compression that results in much smaller "
"file size, but require significantly more processing power to play back."
msgstr ""
"Ogg Vorbis 파일은 높은 압축률로 압축해 사용해 파일의 용량이 작습니다. 하지만 "

"MP3 files use better compression than WAV with IMA-ADPCM, but worse than Ogg "
"Vorbis. This means that a MP3 file with roughly equal quality to Ogg Vorbis "
"will be significantly larger. On the bright side, MP3 requires less CPU "
"usage to play back compared to Ogg Vorbis."
msgstr ""
"MP3 파일은 WAV의 IMA-ADPCM보다는 압축률이 높지만 Ogg Vorbis보다는 압축률이 작"

"지만 MP3는 Ogg Vorbis보다 CPU를 더 적게 사용한다는 장점이 있습니다. 이 점 때"
