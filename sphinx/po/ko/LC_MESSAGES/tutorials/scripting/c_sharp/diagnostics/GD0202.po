"To fix a violation of this rule, change the parameter type to be Variant-"
"compatible or remove the ``[Signal]`` attribute from the delegate. Note that "
"removing the attribute will mean the signal is not registered."

msgid ""
"If the signal doesn't need to interact with Godot, consider using `C# events "
"<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/events/"
">`_ directly. Pure C# events allow you to use any C# type for its parameters."

msgid "When to suppress warnings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Signal delegates with parameters "
"that can't be marshalled will result in runtime errors when emitting the "
