msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "소개"

msgid ""
"Historically, level of detail in 3D games involved manually authoring meshes "
"with lower geometry density, then configuring the distance thresholds at "
"which these lower-detailed meshes should be drawn. This approach is still "
"used today when increased control is needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, in projects that have a large amount of detailed 3D assets, setting "
"up LOD manually can be a very time-consuming process. As a result, automatic "
"mesh decimation and LOD configuration is becoming increasingly popular."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides a way to automatically generate less detailed meshes for LOD "
"usage on import, then use those LOD meshes when needed automatically. This "
"is completely transparent to the user. The `meshoptimizer <https://"
"meshoptimizer.org/>`__ library is used for LOD mesh generation behind the "
"scenes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mesh LOD works with any node that draws 3D meshes. This includes "
"MeshInstance3D, MultiMeshInstance3D, GPUParticles3D and CPUParticles3D."
msgstr ""

msgid "Visual comparison"
msgstr "시각적 비교"

msgid ""
"Here is an example of LOD meshes generated on import. Lower detailed meshes "
"will be used when the camera is far away from the object:"
msgstr ""

msgid "From most detailed (left) to least detailed (right), shaded view"

msgid ""
"Here's the same image with wireframe rendering to make the decimation easier "
"to see:"
msgstr ""

msgid "From most detailed (left) to least detailed (right), wireframe view"

msgid ""
"If you need to manually configure level of detail with artist-created "
"meshes, use :ref:`doc_visibility_ranges` instead of automatic mesh LOD."

msgid "Generating mesh LOD"
msgstr "Keystore 생성하기"

msgid ""
"By default, mesh LOD generation happens automatically for imported 3D scenes "
"(glTF, .blend, Collada, FBX). Once LOD meshes are generated, they will "
"automatically be used when rendering the scene. You don't need to configure "
"anything manually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, mesh LOD generation does **not** automatically happen for imported "
"3D meshes (OBJ). This is because OBJ files are not imported as full 3D "
"scenes by default, but only as individual mesh resources to load into a "
"MeshInstance3D node (or GPUParticles3D, CPUParticles3D, ...)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make an OBJ file have mesh LOD generated for it, select it in the "
"FileSystem dock, go to the Import dock, change its **Import As** option to "
"**Scene** then click **Reimport**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Changing the import type on an OBJ file in the Import dock"
msgstr ""

msgid "This will require restarting the editor after clicking **Reimport**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The mesh LOD generation process is not perfect, and may occasionally "
"introduce rendering issues (especially in skinned meshes). Mesh LOD "
"generation can also take a while on complex meshes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If mesh LOD causes a specific mesh to look broken, you can disable LOD "
"generation for it in the Import dock. This will also speed up resource "
"importing. This can be done globally in the 3D scene's import options, or on "
"a per-mesh basis using the Advanced Import Settings dialog."

msgid "Comparing mesh LOD visuals and performance"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To disable mesh LOD in the editor for comparison purposes, use the **Disable "
"Mesh LOD** advanced debug draw mode. This can be done using the menu in the "
"top-left corner of the 3D viewport (labeled **Perspective** or "
"**Orthogonal** depending on camera mode):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling mesh LOD in the 3D viewport's top-left menu"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enable **View Frame Time** in the same menu to view FPS in the top-right "
"corner. Also enable **View Information** in the same menu to view the number "
"of primitives (vertices + indices) rendered in the bottom-right corner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If mesh LOD is working correctly in your scene and your camera is far away "
"enough from the mesh, you should notice the number of drawn primitives "
"decreasing and FPS increasing when mesh LOD is left enabled (unless you are "
"CPU-bottlenecked)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To see mesh LOD decimation in action, change the debug draw mode to "
"**Display Wireframe** in the menu specified above, then adjust the "
"**Rendering > Mesh LOD > LOD Change > Threshold Pixels** project setting."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuring mesh LOD performance and quality"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can adjust how aggressive mesh LOD transitions should be in the root "
"viewport by changing the **Rendering > Mesh LOD > LOD Change > Threshold "
"Pixels** project setting. To change this value at run-time, set "
"``mesh_lod_threshold`` on the root viewport as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each viewport has its own ``mesh_lod_threshold`` property, which can be set "
"independently from other viewports."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default mesh LOD threshold of 1 pixel is tuned to look *perceptually* "
"lossless; it provides a significant performance gain with an unnoticeable "
"loss in quality. Higher values will make LOD transitions happen sooner when "
"the camera moves away, resulting in higher performance but lower quality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to perform per-object adjustments to mesh LOD, you can adjust "
"how aggressive LOD transitions should be by adjusting the **LOD Bias** "
"property on any node that inherits from GeometryInstance3D. Values *above* "
"``1.0`` will make LOD transitions happen later than usual (resulting in "
"higher quality but lower performance). Values *below* ``1.0`` will make LOD "
"transitions happen sooner than usual (resulting in lower quality but higher "
"performance)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, ReflectionProbe nodes have their own **Mesh LOD Threshold** "
"property that can be adjusted to improve rendering performance when the "
"reflection probe updates. This is especially important for ReflectionProbes "
"that use the **Always** update mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When rendering the scene, mesh LOD selection uses a screen-space metric. "
"This means it automatically takes camera field of view and viewport "
"resolution into account. Higher camera FOV and lower viewport resolutions "
"will make LOD selection more aggressive; the engine will display heavily "
"decimated models earlier when the camera moves away."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, unlike :ref:`doc_visibility_ranges`, you don't need to do "
"anything specific in your project to take camera FOV and viewport resolution "
"into account."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using mesh LOD with MultiMesh and particles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For LOD selection, the point of the node's :abbr:`AABB (Axis-Aligned "
"Bounding Box)` that is the closest to the camera is used as a basis. This "
"applies to any kind of mesh LOD (including for individual MeshInstance3D)s, "
"but this has some implications for nodes that display multiple meshes at "
"once, such as MultiMeshInstance3D, GPUParticles3D and GPUParticles3D. Most "
"importantly, this means that all instances will be drawn with the same LOD "
"level at a given time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are noticing incorrect LOD selection with GPUParticles3D, make sure "
"the node's visibility AABB is configured by selecting the GPUParticles3D "
"node and using **GPUParticles3D > Generate AABB** at the top of the 3D "
"viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have instances in a MultiMesh that are far away from each other, they "
"should be placed in a separate MultiMeshInstance3D node. Doing so will also "
"improve rendering performance, as frustum and occlusion culling will be able "
"to cull individual nodes (while they can't cull individual instances in a "
"MultiMesh)."
