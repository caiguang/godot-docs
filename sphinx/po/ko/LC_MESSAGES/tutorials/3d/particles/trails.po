"Godot provides several types of trails you can add to a particle system. "
"Before you can work with trails, you need to set up a couple of parameters "
"first. Create a new particle system and assign a process material :ref:`as "
"described before <doc_creating_3d_particle_system>`. In the ``Trails`` group "
"of the particle system, check the box next to ``Enabled`` and increase the "
"emission duration by setting ``Lifetime`` to something like ``0.8``. On the "
"process material, set ``Direction`` to ``(X=0,Y=1.0,Z=0)`` and ``Initial "
"Velocity`` to ``10.0`` for both ``Min`` and ``Max``."

msgid ""
"The only thing that's still missing is a mesh for the draw pass. The type of "
"mesh that you set here controls what kind of particle trail you will end up "
"with."

msgid ""
"The simplest type of particle trail is the ribbon trail. Navigate to the "
"``Draw Passes`` section and select ``New RibbonTrailMesh`` from the options "
"for ``Pass 1``. A :ref:`RibbonTrailMesh <class_RibbonTrailMesh>` is a simple "
"quad that is divided into sections and then stretched and repeated along "
"those sections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assign a new :ref:`Standard Material <doc_standard_material_3d>` to the "
"``Material`` property and enable ``Use Particle Trails`` in the "
"``Transform`` property group. The particles should now be emitting in trails."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You have two options for the ribbon mesh ``Shape`` parameter. ``Cross`` "
"creates two perpendicular quads, making the particle trail a little more "
"three-dimensional. This really only makes sense if you don't draw the trails "
"in ``Particle Billboard`` mode and helps when looking at the particles from "
"different angles. The ``Flat`` option limits the mesh to a single quad and "
"works best with billboard particles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Size`` parameter controls the trail's width. Use it to make trails "
"wider or more narrow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Sections``, ``Section Length`` and ``Section Segments`` all work together "
"to control how smooth the particle trail looks. When a particle trail does "
"not travel in a straight line, the more sections it has the smoother it "
"looks as it bends and swirls. ``Section Length`` controls the length of each "
"section. Multiply this value by the number of sections to know the trail's "
"total length."

msgid ""
"3 sections, 1m section length (left) vs. 12 sections, 0.25m section length "
"(right). Notice how the total length of the trails stays the same."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Section Segments`` parameter further subdivides each section into "
"segments. It has no effect on the smoothness of the trail's sections, "
"though. Instead, it controls the smoothness of the particle trail's overall "
"shape. The ``Curve`` property defines this shape. Click the box next to "
"``Curve`` and assign or create a new curve. The trail will be shaped just "
"like the curve with the curve's value at ``0.0`` at the trail's head and the "
"curve's value at ``1.0`` at the trail's tail."

"Particle trails shaped by different curves. The trails move from left to "
"right."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Depending on the complexity of the curve, the particle trail's shape will "
"not look very smooth when the number of sections is low. This is where the "
"``Section Segments`` property comes in. Increasing the amount of section "
"segments adds more vertices to the trail's sides so that it can follow the "
"curve more closely."

msgid "Tube trails"

"Tube trails share a lot of their properties with ribbon trails. The big "
"difference between them is that tube trails emit cylindrical meshes instead "
"of quads."

msgid ""
"To create a tube trail, navigate to the ``Draw Passes`` section and select "
"``New TubeTrailMesh`` from the options for ``Pass 1``. A :ref:`TubeTrailMesh "
"<class_TubeTrailMesh>` is a cylinder that is divided into sections and then "
"stretched and repeated along those sections. Assign a new :ref:`Standard "
"Material <doc_standard_material_3d>` to the ``Material`` property and enable "
"``Use Particle Trails`` in the ``Transform`` property group. The particles "
"should now be emitting in long, cylindrical trails."

msgid ""
"The ``Radius`` and ``Radial Steps`` properties are to tube trails what "
"``Size`` is to ribbon trails. ``Radius`` defines the radius of the tube and "
"increases or decreases its overall size. ``Radial Steps`` controls the "
"number of sides around the tube's circumference. A higher value increases "
"the resolution of the tube's cap."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Sections`` and ``Section Length`` work the same for tube trails and ribbon "
"trails. They control how smooth the tube trail looks when it is bending and "
"twisting instead of moving in a straight line. Increasing the number of "
"sections will make it look smoother. Change the ``Section Length`` property "
"to change the length of each section and with it the total length of the "
"trail. ``Section Rings`` is the tube equivalent of the ``Section Segments`` "
"property for ribbons. It subdivides the sections and adds more geometry to "
"the tube to better fit the custom shape defined in the ``Curve`` property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can shape tube trails with curves, just as you can with ribbon trails. "
"Click the box next to the ``Curve`` property and assign or create a new "
"curve. The trail will be shaped like the curve with the curve's value at "
"``0.0`` at the trail's head and the curve's value at ``1.0`` at the trail's "
"tail."

"An important property you might want to set is ``Transform Align`` in the "
"particle system's ``Drawing`` group. If you leave it as is, the tubes will "
"not preserve volume; they flatten out as they move because their Y-axis "
"keeps pointing up even as they change direction. This can cause a lot of "
"rendering artifacts. Set the property to ``Y to Velocity`` instead and each "
"particle trail keeps its Y-axis aligned along the direction of its movement."
