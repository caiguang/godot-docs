msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "소개"

msgid ""
"``StandardMaterial3D`` and ``ORMMaterial3D`` (Occlusion, Roughness, "
"Metallic) are default 3D materials that aim to provide most of the features "
"artists look for in a material, without the need for writing shader code. "
"However, they can be converted to shader code if additional functionality is "
"needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "This tutorial explains the parameters present in both materials."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are 4 ways to add these materials to an object. A material can be "
"added in the *Material* property of the mesh. It can be added in the "
"*Material* property of the node using the mesh (such as a MeshInstance3D "
"node), the *Material Override* property of the node using the mesh, and the "
"*Material Overlay*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you add a material to the mesh itself, every time that mesh is used it "
"will have that material. If you add a material to the node using the mesh, "
"the material will only be used by that node, it will also override the "
"material property of the mesh. If a material is added in the *Material "
"Override* property of the node, it will only be used by that node. It will "
"also override the regular material property of the node and the material "
"property of the mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Material Overlay* property will render a material **over** the current "
"one being used by the mesh. As an example, this can be used to put a "
"transparent shield effect on a mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid "BaseMaterial 3D settings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"StandardMaterial3D has many settings that determine the look of a material. "
"All of these are under the BaseMaterial3D category"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"ORM materials are almost exactly the same with one difference. Instead of "
"separate settings and textures for occlusion, roughness, and metallic, there "
"is a single ORM texture. The different color channels of that texture are "
"used for each parameter. Programs such as Substance Painter and Armor Paint "
"will give you the option to export in this format, for these two programs "
"it's with the export preset for unreal engine, which also uses ORM textures."

msgid "Transparency"
msgstr "투명"

msgid ""
"By default, materials in Godot are opaque. This is fast to render, but it "
"means the material can't be seen through even if you use a transparent "
"texture in the **Albedo > Texture** property (or set **Albedo > Color** to a "
"transparent color)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To be able to see through a material, the material needs to be made "
"*transparent*. Godot offers several transparency modes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** Material is opaque. This is the fastest to render, with all "
"rendering features supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha:** Material is transparent. Semi-transparent areas are drawn with "
"blending. This is slow to render, but it allows for partial transparency "
"(also known as translucency). Materials using alpha blending also can't cast "
"shadows, and are not visible in screen-space reflections."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Alpha** is a good fit for particle effects and VFX."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Scissor:** Material is transparent. Semi-transparent areas whose "
"opacity is below **Alpha Scissor Threshold** are not drawn (above this "
"opacity, these are drawn as opaque). This is faster to render than Alpha and "
"doesn't exhibit transparency sorting issues. The downside is that this "
"results in \"all or nothing\" transparency, with no intermediate values "
"possible. Materials using alpha scissor can cast shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Scissor** is ideal for foliage and fences, since these have hard "
"edges and require correct sorting to look good."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Hash:** Material is transparent. Semi-transparent areas are drawn "
"using dithering. This is also \"all or nothing\" transparency, but dithering "
"helps represent partially opaque areas with limited precision depending on "
"viewport resolution. Materials using alpha hash can cast shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Hash** is suited for realistic-looking hair, although stylized hair "
"may work better with alpha scissor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Depth Pre-Pass:** This renders the object's fully opaque pixels via the "
"opaque pipeline first, then renders the rest with alpha blending. This "
"allows transparency sorting to be *mostly* correct (albeit not fully so, as "
"partially transparent regions may still exhibit incorrect sorting). "
"Materials using depth prepass can cast shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot will automatically force the material to be transparent with alpha "
"blending if *any* of these conditions is met:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting the transparency mode to **Alpha** (as described here)."

"Alpha-blended transparency has several :ref:`limitations "
"<doc_3d_rendering_limitations_transparency_sorting>`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alpha-blended materials are significantly slower to render, especially if "
"they overlap."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alpha-blended materials may exhibit sorting issues when transparent surfaces "
"overlap each other. This means that surfaces may render in the incorrect "
"order, with surfaces in the back appearing to be in front of those which are "
"actually closer to the camera."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alpha-blended materials don't cast shadows, although they can receive "
"shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alpha-blended materials don't appear in any reflections (other than "
"reflection probes)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Screen-space reflections and sharp SDFGI reflections don't appear on alpha-"
"blended materials. When SDFGI is enabled, rough reflections are used as a "
"fallback regardless of material roughness."

msgid "Alpha Antialiasing"
msgstr "**안티 앨리어싱:**"

msgid ""
"This property is only visible when the transparency mode is **Alpha "
"Scissor** or **Alpha Hash**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While alpha scissor and alpha hash materials are faster to render than alpha-"
"blended materials, they exhibit hard edges between opaque and transparent "
"regions. While it's possible to use post-processing-based :ref:`antialiasing "
"techniques <doc_3d_antialiasing>` such as FXAA and TAA, this is not always "
"desired as these techniques tend to make the final result look blurrier or "
"exhibit ghosting artifacts."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "There are 3 alpha antialiasing modes available:"
msgstr "이렇게 하고 싶어하는 몇 가지 이유가 있습니다:"

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** No alpha antialiasing. Edges of transparent materials will "
"appear aliased unless a post-processing-based antialiasing solution is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Edge Blend:** Results in a smooth transition between opaque and "
"transparent areas. Also known as \"alpha to coverage\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Edge Clip:** Results in a sharp, but still antialiased transition "
"between opaque and transparent areas. Also known as \"alpha to coverage + "
"alpha to one\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the alpha antialiasing mode is set to **Alpha Edge Blend** or **Alpha "
"Edge Clip**, a new **Alpha Antialiasing Edge** property becomes visible "
"below in the inspector. This property controls the threshold below which "
"pixels should be made transparent. While you've already defined an alpha "
"scissor threshold (when using **Alpha Scissor** only), this additional "
"threshold is used to smoothly transition between opaque and transparent "
"pixels. **Alpha Antialiasing Edge** must *always* be set to a value that is "
"strictly below the alpha scissor threshold. The default of ``0.3`` is a "
"sensible value with an alpha scissor of threshold of ``0.5``, but remember "
"to adjust this alpha antialiasing edge when modifying the alpha scissor "
"threshold."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you find the antialiasing effect not effective enough, try increasing "
"**Alpha Antialiasing Edge** while making sure it's below **Alpha Scissor "
"Threshold** (if the material uses alpha scissor). On the other hand, if you "
"notice the texture's appearance visibly changing as the camera moves closer "
"to the material, try decreasing **Alpha Antialiasing Edge**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For best results, MSAA 3D should be set to at least 2× in the Project "
"Settings when using alpha antialiasing. This is because this feature relies "
"on alpha to coverage, which is a feature provided by MSAA."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without MSAA, a fixed dithering pattern is applied on the material's edges, "
"which isn't very effective at smoothing out edges (although it can still "
"help a little)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Blend Mode"
msgstr "혼합 모드"

msgid ""
"Controls the blend mode for the material. Keep in mind that any mode other "
"than *Mix* forces the object to go through the transparent pipeline."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Mix:** Default blend mode, alpha controls how much the object is visible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Add:** The final color of the object is added to the color of the screen, "
"nice for flares or some fire-like effects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Sub:** The final color of the object is subtracted from the color of the "
"screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Mul:** The final color of the object is multiplied with the color of the "
"screen."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cull Mode"
msgstr "컬 모드"

msgid ""
"Determines which side of the object is not drawn when backfaces are rendered:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Back:** The back of the object is culled when not visible (default)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Front:** The front of the object is culled when not visible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** Used for objects that are double-sided (no culling is "
"performed)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Blender has backface culling disabled on materials and will "
"export materials to match how they render in Blender. This means that "
"materials in Godot will have their cull mode set to **Disabled**. This can "
"decrease performance since backfaces will be rendered, even when they are "
"being culled by other faces. To resolve this, enable **Backface Culling** in "
"Blender's Materials tab, then export the scene to glTF again."
msgstr ""
"Blender는 기본적으로 재질의 backface culling이 비활성화 되어 있으며 Blender에"

"with transparent grass or tree foliage."
msgstr ""

msgid "No Depth Test"
msgstr "깊이 테스트 없음"

msgid ""
"In order for close objects to appear over far away objects, depth testing is "
"performed. Disabling it has the result of objects appearing over (or under) "

#, fuzzy
msgid "Shading mode"
msgstr "셰이딩"

msgid ""
"Godot has a more or less uniform cost per pixel thanks to depth pre-pass. "
"All lighting calculations are made by running the lighting shader on every "
"pixel."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As these calculations are costly, performance can be brought down "
"considerably in some corner cases such as drawing several layers of "
"transparency (which is common in particle systems). Switching to per-vertex "
"lighting may help in these cases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, on low-end or mobile devices, switching to vertex lighting can "
"considerably increase rendering performance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that when vertex lighting is enabled, only directional lighting "
"can produce shadows (for performance reasons)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, in some cases you might want to show just the albedo (color) and "
"ignore the rest. To do this you can set the shading mode to unshaded"

"**Lambert Wrap:** Extends Lambert to cover more than 90 degrees when "
"roughness increases. Works great for hair and simulating cheap subsurface "
"scattering. This implementation is energy conserving."
msgstr ""

"**Oren Nayar:** This implementation aims to take microsurfacing into account "
"(via roughness). Works well for clay-like materials and some types of cloth."

"*Albedo* is the base color for the material, on which all the other settings "

msgid "Metallic"
msgstr "금속성"

msgid ""
"Godot uses a metallic model over competing models due to its simplicity. "
"This parameter defines how reflective the material is. The more reflective, "

msgstr ""

msgid "Roughness"
msgstr "굵기"

msgid ""
"*Roughness* affects the way reflection happens. A value of ``0`` makes it a "

"Some fabrics have small micro-fur that causes light to scatter around it. "
"Godot emulates this with the *Rim* parameter. Unlike other rim lighting "

msgid ""
"Rim size depends on roughness, and there is a special parameter to specify "
"how it must be colored. If *Tint* is ``0``, the color of the light is used "
