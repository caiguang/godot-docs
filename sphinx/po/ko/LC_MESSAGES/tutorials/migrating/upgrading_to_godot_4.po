msgid ""
"If you don't *need* any features present in Godot 4.0, you may want to stay "
"on Godot 3.x for the following reasons:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Godot 3.x is tried and true, while Godot 4 remains in its early stages. "
"<https://godotengine.org/article/release-management-4-0-and-beyond>`__"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot 4.0 is expected to contain workflow and performance issues that Godot "
"3.x doesn't have. These issues will be ironed out over time in future Godot "
"4.x releases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot 4 has fewer third-party tutorials available compared to Godot 3.x. If "
"you're new to game engines, you may have a better experience using Godot 3.x "
"as a result."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot 4's baseline hardware requirements (such as memory usage) are slightly "
"higher, both for the editor and exported projects. This was required for the "
"implementation of some core optimizations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since Godot 4 includes more features than Godot 3, Godot 4's binary size for "
"exported projects is larger. While this can be mitigated by :ref:`optimizing "
"a build for size <doc_optimizing_for_size>`, a 4.0 build with a given set of "
"enabled modules will remain larger compared to a 3.x build with the same "
"modules. This can be an issue for :ref:`exporting to the Web "
"<doc_exporting_for_web>`, as binary size directly influences how fast the "
"engine can initialize (regardless of download speed)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot 4 does not and will not have support for GLES2 rendering. (There is "
"still support for GLES3 rendering using the new OpenGL backend, which means "
"that devices without Vulkan support can still run Godot 4.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are targeting **very** old hardware such as Intel Sandy Bridge (2nd "
"generation) integrated graphics, this will prevent the project from running "
"on such hardware after upgrading. `Software OpenGL implementations <https://"
"github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win>`__ can be used to bypass this limitation, "
"but they're too slow for gaming."
msgstr ""

msgid "Caveats of upgrading"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Since Godot 4 is a complete rewrite in many aspects, some features have "
"unfortunately been lost in the process.** Some of these features may be "
"restored in future Godot releases:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bullet physics was removed in favor of GodotPhysics. This only affects 3D "
"projects that used the default physics engine (which was Bullet) and didn't "
"manually change it to GodotPhysics. There are no plans to re-add Bullet "
"physics in core, but a third-party add-on could be created for it thanks to "
"GDExtension."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rendering in 2D is no longer performed in HDR, which means \"overbright\" "
"modulate values have no visible effect. This is planned to be restored at "
"some point in the future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While rendering still happens in HDR in 3D when using the Forward Plus or "
"Forward Mobile backends, Viewports cannot return HDR data anymore. This is "
"planned to be restored at some point in the future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mono was replaced by .NET 6. This means exporting C# projects to Android, "
"iOS and HTML5 is no longer supported for now. Exporting C# projects to "
"desktop platforms is still supported, and as of 4.2 there's experimental "
"support for exporting to mobile platforms. Support for exporting C# projects "
"to more platforms will be restored in future 4.x releases as upstream "
"support improves."

"This way, you won't be relying on the deprecated Tween node and OS time "
