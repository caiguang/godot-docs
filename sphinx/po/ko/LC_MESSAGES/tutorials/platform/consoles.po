"In order to develop for consoles in Godot, you need access to the console "
"SDK and export templates for it. These export templates need to be developed "
"either by yourself or someone hired to do it, or provided by a third party "
"company."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Currently, the only console Godot officially supports is Steam Deck (through "
"the official Linux export templates)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The reason other consoles are not officially supported are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To develop for consoles, one must be licensed as a company. As an open "
"source project, Godot has no legal structure to provide console ports."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Console SDKs are secret and covered by non-disclosure agreements. Even if we "
"could get access to them, we could not publish the platform-specific code "
"under an open source license."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As explained, however, it is possible to port your games to consoles thanks "
"to services provided by third-party companies."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine. In "
"other words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to distribute "
"console export templates without requiring the user to prove that they are a "
"licensed console developer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Console publishing process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regardless of the engine used to create the game, the process to publish a "
"game to a console platform is as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then "
"sign NDAs and publishing contracts. This requires you to have a registered "
"legal entity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. "
"This can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly "
"easier if an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is "
"generally known to be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not "
"guaranteed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Get access to developer tools and order a console specially made for "
"developers (*devkit*). The cost of those devkits is confidential."
msgstr ""

msgid "Port the engine to the console platform or pay a company to do it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to "
"sell it in. For example, game ratings are handled by `ESRB <https://www.esrb."
"org/>`__ in North America, and `PEGI <https://pegi.info/>`__ in Europe. "
"Indie developers can generally get a rating for cheaper compared to more "
"established developers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to the complexity of the process, many studios and developers prefer to "
"outsource console porting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can read more about the console publishing process in this article: "
