"Turbulence uses a noise texture to add variation and interesting patterns to "
"particle movement. It can be combined with :ref:`particle attractors "
"<doc_3d_particles_attractors>` and :ref:`collision "
"<doc_3d_particles_collision>` nodes to create even more complex looking "

"There are two things you have to do before turbulence has any effect on a "
"particle system. First you must add movement to the particle system. "
"Turbulence modifies a particle's movement direction and speed, but it "
"doesn't create any. It is enough to give the particle system some gravity, "
"but you can just as well create a number of attractors if you want the "
"particles to follow a more complex movement path. Second, you need to :ref:"
"`enable turbulence in the particle process material "
"<doc_process_material_properties_turbulence>`. Once enabled, you have access "
"to all the turbulence properties."

"Turbulence makes use of 3D noise, which has a high performance cost on the "
"GPU. Only enable turbulence on a few particle systems on screen at most. "
"Using turbulence is not recommended when targeting mobile/web platforms."

msgid "Noise properties"
msgstr "Düzenlenebilir özellikler."

msgid ""
"The basis for particle turbulence is a noise pattern. There are several "
"properties that allow you to manipulate different attributes of this pattern."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Noise Strength`` property controls the pattern's contrast, which "
"affects the overall turbulence sharpness. A lower value creates a softer "
"pattern where individual movement paths are not as sharply separated from "
"another. Set this to a higher number to make the pattern more distinct."
msgstr ""

msgid "Turbulence noise strength"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At a value of 1 (left), the noise strength produces softer turbulence "
"patterns than at 20 (right)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Noise Scale`` property controls the pattern's frequency. It basically "
"changes the noise texture's UV scale where a smaller value produces finer "
"detail, but repeating patterns become noticeable faster. A larger value "
"results in a weaker turbulence pattern overall, but the particle system can "
"cover a larger area before repetition starts to become an issue."
msgstr ""

msgid "Turbulence noise scale"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Turbulence noise scale produces finer details at a value of 1.5 (left) than "
"at 6 (right)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Noise Speed`` property takes a vector and controls the noise panning "
"speed and direction. This allows you to move the noise pattern over time, "
"which adds another layer of movement variation to the particle system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't mix up particle movement speed and noise panning speed! They are two "
"different things. Particle movement is determined by a number of properties, "
"including the turbulence noise. The ``Noise Speed`` property moves the "
"pattern itself, which in turn changes where the noise affects the particles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At a value of ``(X=0,Y=0,Z=0)``, the noise pattern doesn't move at all. The "
"influence on particle movement stays the same at any given point. Set the "
"speed to ``(X=1,Y=0,Z=0)`` instead, and the noise pattern moves along the X-"
"axis."
msgstr ""

msgid "Turbulence noise speed"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Different noise speed values. Left\\: (X=0,Y=0,Z=0), middle\\: (X=0.5,Y=0.5,"
"Z=0.5), right\\: (X=0,Y=-2,Z=0)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Noise Speed Random`` property adds some randomness to the noise "
"panning speed. This helps with breaking up visible patterns, especially at "
"higher panning speeds when repetition becomes noticeable faster."

msgid "Influence properties"
msgstr "Düzenlenebilir özellikler."

msgid ""
"The influence properties determine how much each particle is affected by "
"turbulence. Use ``Influence Min`` to set a minimum value and ``Influence "
"Max`` to set a maximum value. When a particle spawns, the influence is "
"randomly chosen from within this range. You can also set up a curve with the "
"``Influence Over Life`` property that modifies that value over each "
"particle's lifetime. These three properties together control the strength of "
"the turbulence's effect on the particle system :ref:`as described before "
"<doc_process_material_properties>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since these properties affect the overall influence of the turbulence over a "
"particle system, both movement direction and speed change as you set "
"different values. A stronger influence causes a particle to move faster and "
"all particles to follow along narrower paths as a result of that."
msgstr ""

msgid "Turbulence influence"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice how the particle paths are more narrow and less spread out at high "
"influence values (right)"

msgid "Displacement properties"
msgstr "Düzenlenebilir özellikler."

msgid ""
"Displacement changes a particle's starting position. Use ``Initial "
"Displacement Min`` to set a lower limit and ``Initial Displacement Max`` to "
"set an upper limit. When a particle spawns, the amount of displacement is "
"randomly chosen from within this range and multiplied by a random direction."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Displacement is very useful to break up regular shapes or to create complex "
"shapes from simpler ones. The only difference between the particle systems "
"in the screenshot below is the value given to the displacement properties."
msgstr ""

msgid "Turbulence displacement"
