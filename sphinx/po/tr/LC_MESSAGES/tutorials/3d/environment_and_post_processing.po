msgstr "Ortam ve sonra-işleme"

msgid ""
"Godot 4 provides a redesigned Environment resource, as well as a new post-"
"processing system with many available effects right out of the box."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As of Godot 4, Environment *performance/quality* settings are defined in the "
"project settings instead of in the Environment resource. This makes global "
"adjustments easier, as you no longer have to tweak Environment resources "
"individually to suit various hardware configurations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that most Environment performance/quality settings are only visible "
"after enabling the **Advanced** toggle in the Project Settings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Environment"
msgstr "Ortam"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`class_Environment` resource stores all the information required "
"for controlling the 2D and 3D rendering environment. This includes the sky, "
"ambient lighting, tone mapping, effects, and adjustments. By itself, it does "
"nothing, but you can enable it by using it in one of the following "
"locations, in order of priority:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Camera3D node (high priority)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An Environment can be set to a Camera3D node. It will have priority over any "
"other setting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is mostly useful when you want to override an existing environment, but "
"in general it's a better idea to use the option below."
msgstr ""

msgid "WorldEnvironment node (medium priority, recommended)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The WorldEnvironment node can be added to any scene, but only one can exist "
"per active scene tree. Adding more than one will result in a warning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any Environment added has higher priority than the default Environment "
"(explained below). This means it can be overridden on a per-scene basis, "
"which makes it quite useful."
msgstr ""

msgid "Preview environment and sun (low priority)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since Godot 4, the preview environment and sun system replace the "
"``default_env.tres`` file that was used in Godot 3 projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no WorldEnvironment node or DirectionalLight3D node is present in the "
"current scene, the editor will display a preview environment and sun "
"instead. This can be disabled using the buttons at the top of the 3D editor:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Clicking on the 3 vertical dots on the right will display a dialog which "
"allows you to customize the appearance of the preview environment:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**The preview sun and sky is only visible in the editor, not in the running "
"project.** Using the buttons at the bottom of the dialog, you can add the "
"preview sun and sky into the scene as nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you hold :kbd:`Shift` while clicking **Add Sun to Scene** or **Add "
"Environment to Scene** in the preview environment editor, this will add both "
"a preview sun and environment to the current scene (as if you clicked both "
"buttons separately). Use this to speed up project setup and prototyping."
msgstr ""

msgid "Camera attributes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot 4, exposure and depth of field information was split from the "
"Environment resource into a separate CameraAttributes resource. This allows "
"adjusting those properties independently of other Environment settings more "
"easily."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ref:`class_CameraAttributes` resource stores exposure and depth of "
"field information. It also allows enabling automatic exposure adjustments "
"depending on scene brightness."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "There are two kinds of CameraAttribute resources available:"
msgstr "Kullanabileceğiniz iki tür işlem var:"

msgid ""
"**CameraAttributesPractical:** Features are exposed using arbitrary units, "
"which are easier to reason about for most game use cases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**CameraAttributesPhysical:** Features are exposed using real world units, "
"similar to a digital camera. For example, field of view is set using a focal "
"length in millimeters instead of a value in degrees. Recommended when "
"physical accuracy is important, such as for photorealistic rendering."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both CameraAttribute resource types allow you to use the same features, but "
"they are configured differently. If you don't know which one to choose, use "
"**CameraAttributesPractical**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using a :ref:`class_CameraAttributesPhysical` on a Camera3D node will lock "
"out FOV and aspect adjustments in that Camera3D, as field of view is "
"adjusted in the CameraAttributesPhysical resource instead. If used in a "
"WorldEnvironment, the CameraAttributesPhysical will not override any "
"Camera3D in the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A CameraAttributes resource can be added to a Camera3D or a WorldEnvironment "
"node. When the current camera has a CameraAttributes set, it will *override* "
"the one set in WorldEnvironment (if any)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most situations, setting the CameraAttributes resource on the Camera3D "
"node instead of the WorldEnvironment is recommended. Unlike "
"WorldEnvironment, assigning the CameraAttributes resource to the Camera3D "
"node prevents depth of field from displaying in the 3D editor viewport, "
"unless the camera is being previewed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Environment options"
msgstr "Ortam seçenekleri"

msgid ""
"The following is a detailed description of all environment options and how "
"they are intended to be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Background"
msgstr "Arkaplan"

msgid ""
"The Background section contains settings on how to fill the background "
"(parts of the screen where objects were not drawn). The background not only "
"serves the purpose of displaying an image or color. By default, it also "
"affects how objects are affected by ambient and reflected light. This is "
"called image-based lighting (IBL)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, the background sky may greatly impact your scene's overall "
"appearance, even if the sky is never directly visible on screen. This should "
"be taken into account when tweaking lighting in your scene."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "There are several background modes available:"
msgstr "Bunun için bir çok neden var:"

msgid ""
"**Clear Color** uses the default clear color defined in the project "
"settings. The background will be a constant color."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Custom Color** is like Clear Color, but with a custom color value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Sky** lets you define a background sky material (see below). By default, "
"objects in the scene will reflect this sky material and absorb ambient light "
"from it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Canvas** displays the 2D scene as a background to the 3D scene. This can "
"be used to make environment effects visible on 2D rendering, such as :ref:"
"`glow in 2D <doc_environment_and_post_processing_using_glow_in_2d>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Keep** does not draw any sky, keeping what was present on previous frames "
"instead. This improves performance in purely indoor scenes, but creates a "
"\"hall of mirrors\" visual glitch if the sky is visible at any time."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Sky materials"
msgstr "Malzemeler"

msgid ""
"When using the **Sky** background mode (or the ambient/reflected light mode "
"is set to **Sky**), a Sky subresource becomes available to edit in the "
"Environment resource. Editing this subresource allows you to create a "
"SkyMaterial resource within the Sky."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are 3 built-in sky materials to choose from:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**PanoramaSkyMaterial:** Use a 360 degree panorama sky image (2:1 aspect "
"ratio recommended). To benefit from high dynamic range, the panorama image "
"must be in an HDR-compatible format such as ``.hdr`` or ``.exr`` rather than "
"a standard dynamic range format like ``.png`` or ``.jpg``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**ProceduralSkyMaterial:** Use a procedurally generated sky with adjustable "
"ground, sun, sky and horizon colors. This is the type of sky used in the "
"editor preview. The sun's position is automatically derived from the first 4 "
"DirectionalLight3D nodes present in the scene. There can be up to 4 suns at "
"a given time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**PhysicalSkyMaterial:** Use a physically-based procedural sky with "
"adjustable scattering parameters. The sun's position is automatically "
"derived from the first DirectionalLight3D node present in the scene. "
"PhysicalSkyMaterial is slightly more expensive to render compared to "
"ProceduralSkyMaterial. There can be up to 1 sun at a given time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Panorama sky images are sometimes called HDRIs (High Dynamic Range Images). "
"You can find freely licensed HDRIs on `Poly Haven <https://polyhaven.com/"
"hdris>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"HDR PanoramaSkyMaterial textures with very bright spots (such as real life "
"photos with the sun visible) may result in visible sparkles on ambient and "
"specular reflections. This is caused by the texture's peak exposure being "
"too high."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To resolve this, select the panorama texture in the FileSystem dock, go to "
"the Import dock, enable **HDR Clamp Exposure** then click **Reimport**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need a custom sky material (e.g. for procedural clouds), you can "
"create a custom :ref:`sky shader <doc_sky_shader>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ambient light"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ambient light (as defined here) is a type of light that affects every piece "
"of geometry with the same intensity. It is global and independent of lights "
"that might be added to the scene. Ambient light is one of the two components "
"of image-based lighting. Unlike reflected light, ambient light does not vary "
"depending on the camera's position and viewing angle."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "There are several types of ambient light to choose from:"
msgstr "Bunun için bir çok neden var:"

msgid ""
"**Background:** Source ambient light from the background, such as the sky, "
"custom color or clear color (default). Ambient light intensity will vary "
"depending on the sky image's contents, which can result in more visually "
"appealing ambient lighting. A sky must be set as background for this mode to "
"be visible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** Do not use any ambient light. Useful for purely indoor scenes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Color:** Use a constant color for ambient light, ignoring the background "
"sky. Ambient light intensity will be the same on all sides, which may result "
"in the scene's lighting looking more flat. Useful for indoor scenes where "
"pitch black shadows may be too dark, or to maximize performance on low-end "
"devices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Sky:** Source ambient light from a specified sky, even if the background "
"is set to a mode other than **Sky**. If the background mode is already "
"**Sky**, this mode behaves identically to **Background**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the ambient light mode is set to Sky or Background (and background is "
"set to Sky), it's possible to blend between the ambient color and sky using "
"the **Sky Contribution** property. This value is set to ``1.0`` by default, "
"which means that only the ambient sky is used. The ambient color is ignored "
"unless **Sky Contribution** is decreased below ``1.0``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is a comparison of how different ambient light affects a scene:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, there is an **Energy** setting which is a multiplier. It's useful "
"when working with HDR."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, you should only rely on ambient light alone for simple scenes or "
"large exteriors. You may also do so to boost performance. Ambient light is "
"fast to render, but it doesn't provide the best lighting quality. It's "
"better to generate ambient light from :ref:`ReflectionProbe "
"<doc_reflection_probes>`, :ref:`VoxelGI <doc_using_voxel_gi>` or :ref:`SDFGI "
"<doc_using_sdfgi>`, as these will simulate how indirect light propagates "
"more accurately. Below is a comparison, in terms of quality, between using a "
"flat ambient color and a VoxelGI:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using one of the methods described above will replace constant ambient "
"lighting with ambient lighting from the probes."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Reflected light"
msgstr "Yansımalar"

msgid ""
"Reflected light (also called specular light) is the other of the two "
"components of image-based lighting."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reflected light can be set to one of 3 modes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Background:** Reflect from the background, such as the sky, custom color "
"or clear color (default)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** Do not reflect any light from the environment. Useful for "
"purely indoor scenes, or to maximize performance on low-end devices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Sky:** Reflect from the background sky, even if the background is set to a "
"mode other than **Sky**. If the background mode is already **Sky**, this "
"mode behaves identically to **Background**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fog"
msgstr "Sis"

msgid ""
"This section refers to non-volumetric fog only. It is possible to use both "
"non-volumetric fog and :ref:`doc_volumetric_fog` at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Fog, as in real life, makes distant objects fade away into a uniform color. "
"There are two kinds of fog in Godot:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Depth Fog:** This one is applied based on the distance from the camera."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Height Fog:** This one is applied to any objects below (or above) a "
"certain height, regardless of the distance from the camera."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both of these fog types can have their curve tweaked, making their "
"transition more or less sharp."
msgstr ""

msgid "Two properties can be tweaked to make the fog effect more interesting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first is **Sun Amount**, which makes use of the Sun Color property of "
"the fog. When looking towards a directional light (usually a sun), the color "
"of the fog will be changed, simulating the sunlight passing through the fog."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second is **Transmit Enabled** which simulates more realistic light "
"transmittance. In practice, it makes light stand out more across the fog."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Fog can cause banding to appear on the viewport, especially at higher "
"density levels. See :ref:`doc_3d_rendering_limitations_color_banding` for "
"guidance on reducing banding."
msgstr ""

msgid "Volumetric Fog"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Volumetric fog provides a realistic fog effect to the scene, with fog color "
"being affected by the lights that traverse the fog."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :ref:`doc_volumetric_fog` for documentation on setting up volumetric fog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tonemap"
msgstr "Uyumharitası"

msgid ""
"Tonemap selects the tonemapping curve that will be applied to the scene, "
"from a list of standard curves used in the film and game industries. "
"Tonemapping operators other than Linear are used to make light and dark "
"areas more homogeneous, while also avoiding clipping of bright highlights."
msgstr ""

msgid "The tone mapping options are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Mode:** The tone mapping mode to use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Linear:** The default tonemapping mode. This is the fastest and simplest "
"tonemapping operator, but it causes bright lighting to look blown out, with "
"noticeable clipping in the output colors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Reinhardt:** Performs a variation on rendered pixels' colors by this "
"formula: ``color = color / (1 + color)``. This avoids clipping bright "
"highlights, but the resulting image can look a bit dull."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Filmic:** This avoids clipping bright highlights, with a resulting image "
"that usually looks more vivid than Reinhardt."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**ACES:** Academy Color Encoding System tonemapper. ACES is slightly more "
"expensive than other options, but it handles bright lighting in a more "
"realistic fashion by desaturating it as it becomes brighter. ACES typically "
"has a more contrasted output compared to Reinhardt and Filmic. ACES is the "
"recommended option when aiming for photorealistic visuals. This tonemapping "
"mode was called \"ACES Fitted\" in Godot 3.x."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Exposure:** Tone mapping exposure which simulates amount of light received "
"over time (default: ``1.0``). Higher values result in an overall brighter "
"appearance. If the scene appears too dark as a result of a tonemapping "
"operator or whitepoint change, try increasing this value slightly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**White:** Tone mapping whitepoint, which simulates where in the scale white "
"is located (default: ``1.0``). For photorealistic lighting, recommended "
"values are between ``6.0`` and ``8.0``. Higher values result in less blown "
"out highlights, but make the scene appear slightly darker as a whole."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mid- and post-processing effects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Environment resource supports many popular mid- and post-processing "
"effects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Screen-space effects such as :abbr:`SSR (Screen-Space Reflections)`, :abbr:"
"`SSAO (Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion)`, :abbr:`SSIL (Screen-Space Indirect "
"Lighting)` and glow do not operate on geometry that is located outside the "
"camera view or is occluded by other opaque geometry. Consider this when "
"tweaking their settings to avoid distracting changes during gameplay."
msgstr ""

msgid "Screen-Space Reflections (SSR)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*This feature is only available when using the Forward+ backend, not Mobile "
"or Compatibility.*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While Godot supports several sources of reflection data such as :ref:"
"`doc_reflection_probes`, they may not provide enough detail for all "
"situations. Scenarios where screen-space reflections make the most sense are "
"when objects are in contact with each other (object over floor, over a "
"table, floating on water, etc)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On top of providing more detail, screen-space reflections also work in real-"
"time (while other types of reflections are usually precomputed). This can be "
"used to make characters, cars, etc. reflect on surrounding surfaces when "
"moving around."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Screen-space reflections can be used at the same time as other reflection "
"sources to benefit from detailed reflections when possible, while having a "
"fallback when screen-space reflections cannot be used (for example, to "
"reflect off-screen objects)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A few user-controlled parameters are available to better tweak the technique:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Max Steps:** Determines the length of the reflection. The bigger this "
"number, the more costly it is to compute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Fade In:** Allows adjusting the fade-in curve, which is useful to make the "
"contact area softer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Fade Out:** Allows adjusting the fade-out curve, so the step limit fades "
"out softly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Depth Tolerance:** Can be used to allow screen-space rays to pass behind "
"objects. The rays will treat each object as if it has this depth in "
"determining if it can pass behind the object. Higher values will make screen-"
"space reflections exhibit fewer \"breakups\", at the cost of some objects "
"creating physically incorrect reflections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that screen-space-reflections only work for reflecting opaque "
"geometry. Transparent materials won't be reflected, as they don't write to "
"the depth buffer. This also applies to shaders that use "
"``hint_screen_texture`` or ``hint_depth_texture`` uniforms."
msgstr ""

msgid "Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the **Ambient** section, areas where light from light nodes "
"does not reach (either because it's outside the radius or shadowed) are lit "
"with ambient light. Godot can simulate this using VoxelGI, ReflectionProbe, "
"the Sky, or a constant ambient color. The problem, however, is that all the "
"methods proposed previously act more on a larger scale (large regions) than "
"at the smaller geometry level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Constant ambient color and Sky are the same everywhere, while GI and "
"Reflection probes have more local detail, but not enough to simulate "
"situations where light is not able to fill inside hollow or concave features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can be simulated with Screen Space Ambient Occlusion. As you can see in "
"the image below, its purpose is to make sure concave areas are darker, "
"simulating a narrower path for the light to enter:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is a common mistake to enable this effect, turn on a light, and not be "
"able to appreciate it. This is because :abbr:`SSAO (Screen-Space Ambient "
"Occlusion)` only acts on *ambient* light. It does not affect direct light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is why, in the image above, the effect is less noticeable under the "
"direct light (on the left). If you want to force :abbr:`SSAO (Screen-Space "
"Ambient Occlusion)` to work with direct light too, use the **Light Affect** "
"parameter. Even though this is not physically correct, some artists like how "
"it looks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":abbr:`SSAO (Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion)` looks best when combined with "
"a real source of indirect light, like VoxelGI:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tweaking :abbr:`SSAO (Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion)` is possible with "
"several parameters:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Radius:** The distance at which objects can occlude each other when "
"calculating screen-space ambient occlusion. Higher values will result in "
"occlusion over a greater distance at the cost of performance and quality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Intensity:** The primary screen-space ambient occlusion intensity. Acts as "
"a multiplier for the screen-space ambient occlusion effect. A higher value "
"results in darker occlusion. Since :abbr:`SSAO (Screen-Space Ambient "
"Occlusion)` is a screen-space effect, it's recommended to remain "
"conservative with this value. :abbr:`SSAO (Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion)` "
"that is too strong can be distracting during gameplay."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Power:** The distribution of occlusion. A higher value results in darker "
"occlusion, similar to **Intensity**, but with a sharper falloff."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Detail:** Sets the strength of the additional level of detail for the "
"screen-space ambient occlusion effect. A high value makes the detail pass "
"more prominent, but it may contribute to aliasing in your final image."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Horizon:** The threshold for considering whether a given point on a "
"surface is occluded or not represented as an angle from the horizon mapped "
"into the 0.0-1.0 range. A value of 1.0 results in no occlusion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Sharpness:** The amount that the screen-space ambient occlusion effect is "
"allowed to blur over the edges of objects. Setting too high will result in "
"aliasing around the edges of objects. Setting too low will make object edges "
"appear blurry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Light Affect:** The screen-space ambient occlusion intensity in direct "
"light. In real life, ambient occlusion only applies to indirect light, which "
"means its effects can't be seen in direct light. Values higher than 0 will "
"make the :abbr:`SSAO (Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion)` effect visible in "
"direct light. Values above ``0.0`` are not physically accurate, but some "
"artists prefer this effect."
msgstr ""

msgid "Screen-Space Indirect Lighting (SSIL)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":abbr:`SSIL (Screen-Space Indirect Lighting)` provides indirect lighting for "
"small details or dynamic geometry that other global illumination techniques "
"cannot cover. This applies to bounced diffuse lighting, but also emissive "
"materials. When :abbr:`SSIL (Screen-Space Indirect Lighting)` is enabled on "
"its own, the effect may not be that noticeable, which is intended."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, :abbr:`SSIL (Screen-Space Indirect Lighting)` is meant to be used "
"as a *complement* to other global illumination techniques such as VoxelGI, "
"SDFGI and LightmapGI. :abbr:`SSIL (Screen-Space Indirect Lighting)` also "
"provides a subtle ambient occlusion effect, similar to SSAO but with less "
"detail."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This feature only provides indirect lighting. It is not a full global "
"illumination solution. This makes it different from screen-space global "
"illumination (SSGI) offered by other 3D engines. :abbr:`SSIL (Screen-Space "
"Indirect Lighting)` can be combined with :abbr:`SSR (Screen-Space "
"Reflections)` and/or :abbr:`SSAO (Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion)` for "
"greater visual quality (at the cost of performance)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tweaking :abbr:`SSIL (Screen-Space Indirect Lighting)` is possible with "
"several parameters:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Radius:** The distance that bounced lighting can travel when using the "
"screen space indirect lighting effect. A larger value will result in light "
"bouncing further in a scene, but may result in under-sampling artifacts "
"which look like long spikes surrounding light sources."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Intensity:** The brightness multiplier for the screen-space indirect "
"lighting effect. A higher value will result in brighter light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Sharpness:** The amount that the screen-space indirect lighting effect is "
"allowed to blur over the edges of objects. Setting too high will result in "
"aliasing around the edges of objects. Setting too low will make object edges "
"appear blurry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Normal Rejection:** Amount of normal rejection used when calculating "
"screen-space indirect lighting. Normal rejection uses the normal of a given "
"sample point to reject samples that are facing away from the current pixel. "
"Normal rejection is necessary to avoid light leaking when only one side of "
"an object is illuminated. However, normal rejection can be disabled if light "
"leaking is desirable, such as when the scene mostly contains emissive "
"objects that emit light from faces that cannot be seen from the camera."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signed Distance Field Global Illumination (SDFGI)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Signed distance field global illumination (SDFGI) is a form of real-time "
"global illumination. It is not a screen-space effect, which means it can "
"provide global illumination for off-screen elements (unlike :abbr:`SSIL "
"(Screen-Space Indirect Lighting)`)."

"The light in a pixel surpasses the **HDR Threshold** (where 0 is all light "
"surpasses it, and 1.0 is light over the tonemapper **White** value). "
"Normally, this value is expected to be at 1.0, but it can be lowered to "
"allow more light to bleed. There is also an extra parameter, **HDR Scale**, "
"that allows scaling (making brighter or darker) the light surpassing the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **Bloom** property has a value greater than ``0.0``. As it increases, it "
"sends the whole screen to the glow processor at higher amounts."
msgstr ""

msgid "Both will cause the light to start bleeding out of the brighter areas."
