msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thanks to Godot's input action system, Godot makes it possible to support "
"both keyboard and controller input without having to write separate code "
"paths. Instead of hardcoding keys or controller buttons in your scripts, you "
"should create *input actions* in the Project Settings which will then refer "
"to specified key and controller inputs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Input actions are explained in detail on the :ref:`doc_inputevent` page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike keyboard input, supporting both mouse and controller input for an "
"action (such as looking around in a first-person game) will require "
"different code paths since these have to be handled separately."

msgid "There are 3 ways to get input in an analog-aware way:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you have two axes (such as joystick or WASD movement) and want both "
"axes to behave as a single input, use ``Input.get_vector()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you have one axis that can go both ways (such as a throttle on a flight "
"stick), or when you want to handle separate axes individually, use ``Input."
"get_axis()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For other types of analog input, such as handling a trigger or handling one "
"direction at a time, use ``Input.get_action_strength()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For non-analog digital/boolean input (only \"pressed\" or \"not pressed\" "
"values), such as controller buttons, mouse buttons or keyboard keys, use "
"``Input.is_action_pressed()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to know whether an input was *just* pressed in the previous "
"frame, use ``Input.is_action_just_pressed()`` instead of ``Input."
"is_action_pressed()``. Unlike ``Input.is_action_pressed()`` which returns "
"``true`` as long as the input is held, ``Input.is_action_just_pressed()`` "
"will only return ``true`` for one frame after the button has been pressed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot versions before 3.4, such as 3.3, ``Input.get_vector()`` and "
"``Input.get_axis()`` aren't available. Only ``Input.get_action_strength()`` "
"and ``Input.is_action_pressed()`` are available in Godot 3.3."

msgid "Vibration"
msgstr "Çıkarma"

msgid ""
"Vibration (also called *haptic feedback*) can be used to enhance the feel of "
"a game. For instance, in a racing game, you can convey the surface the car "
"is currently driving on through vibration, or create a sudden vibration on a "
"crash."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the Input singleton's :ref:"
"`start_joy_vibration<class_Input_method_start_joy_vibration>` method to "
"start vibrating a gamepad. Use :ref:"
"`stop_joy_vibration<class_Input_method_stop_joy_vibration>` to stop "
"vibration early (useful if no duration was specified when starting)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On mobile devices, you can also use :ref:"
"`vibrate_handheld<class_Input_method_vibrate_handheld>` to vibrate the "
"device itself (independently from the gamepad). On Android, this requires "
"the ``VIBRATE`` permission to be enabled in the Android export preset before "
"exporting the project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Vibration can be uncomfortable for certain players. Make sure to provide an "
"in-game slider to disable vibration or reduce its intensity."

msgid "Differences between keyboard/mouse and controller input"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're used to handling keyboard and mouse input, you may be surprised by "
"how controllers handle specific situations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dead zone"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike keyboards and mice, controllers offer axes with *analog* inputs. The "
"upside of analog inputs is that they offer additional flexibility for "
"actions. Unlike digital inputs which can only provide strengths of ``0.0`` "
"and ``1.0``, an analog input can provide *any* strength between ``0.0`` and "
"``1.0``. The downside is that without a deadzone system, an analog axis' "
"strength will never be equal to ``0.0`` due to how the controller is "
"physically built. Instead, it will linger at a low value such as ``0.062``. "
"This phenomenon is known as *drifting* and can be more noticeable on old or "
"faulty controllers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's take a racing game as a real-world example. Thanks to analog inputs, "
"we can steer the car slowly in one direction or another. However, without a "
"deadzone system, the car would slowly steer by itself even if the player "
"isn't touching the joystick. This is because the directional axis strength "
"won't be equal to ``0.0`` when we expect it to. Since we don't want our car "
"to steer by itself in this case, we define a \"dead zone\" value of ``0.2`` "
"which will ignore all input whose strength is lower than ``0.2``. An ideal "
"dead zone value is high enough to ignore the input caused by joystick "
"drifting, but is low enough to not ignore actual input from the player."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot features a built-in deadzone system to tackle this problem. The "
"default value is ``0.5``, but you can adjust it on a per-action basis in the "
"Project Settings' Input Map tab. For ``Input.get_vector()``, the deadzone "
"can be specified as an optional 5th parameter. If not specified, it will "
"calculate the average deadzone value from all of the actions in the vector."
msgstr ""

msgid "\"Echo\" events"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike keyboard input, holding down a controller button such as a D-pad "
"direction will **not** generate repeated input events at fixed intervals "
"(also known as \"echo\" events). This is because the operating system never "
"sends \"echo\" events for controller input in the first place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want controller buttons to send echo events, you will have to "
"generate :ref:`class_InputEvent` objects by code and parse them using :ref:"
"`Input.parse_input_event() <class_Input_method_parse_input_event>` at "
"regular intervals. This can be accomplished with the help of a :ref:"
"`class_Timer` node."

msgid "Window focus"
msgstr "Windows"

msgid ""
"Unlike keyboard input, controller inputs can be seen by **all** windows on "
"the operating system, including unfocused windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While this is useful for `third-party split screen functionality <https://"
"nucleus-coop.github.io/>`__, it can also have adverse effects. Players may "
"accidentally send controller inputs to the running project while interacting "
"with another window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you wish to ignore events when the project window isn't focused, you will "
"need to create an :ref:`autoload <doc_singletons_autoload>` called ``Focus`` "
"with the following script and use it to check all your inputs:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, instead of using ``Input.is_action_pressed(action)``, use ``Focus."
"input_is_action_pressed(action)`` where ``action`` is the name of the input "
"action. Also, instead of using ``event.is_action_pressed(action)``, use "
"``Focus.event_is_action_pressed(event, action)`` where ``event`` is an "
"InputEvent reference and ``action`` is the name of the input action."

msgid "Power saving prevention"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike keyboard and mouse input, controller inputs do **not** inhibit sleep "
"and power saving measures (such as turning off the screen after a certain "
"amount of time has passed)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To combat this, Godot enables power saving prevention by default when a "
"project is running. If you notice the system is turning off its display when "
"playing with a gamepad, check the value of **Display > Window > Energy "
"Saving > Keep Screen On** in the Project Settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Linux, power saving prevention requires the engine to be able to use D-"
"Bus. Check whether D-Bus is installed and reachable if running the project "
"within a Flatpak, as sandboxing restrictions may make this impossible by "
"default."

"First, check that your controller is recognized by other applications. You "
"can use the `Gamepad Tester <https://gamepad-tester.com/>`__ website to "
"confirm that your controller is recognized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows Godot only supports up to 4 controllers at a time. This is "
"because Godot uses the XInput API, which is limited to supporting 4 "
"controllers at once. Additional controllers above this limit are ignored by "
"Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid "My controller has incorrectly mapped buttons or axes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, if your controller provides some kind of firmware update utility, "
"make sure to run it to get the latest fixes from the manufacturer. For "
"instance, Xbox One and Xbox Series controllers can have their firmware "
"updated using the `Xbox Accessories app <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/"
"xbox-accessories/9nblggh30xj3>`__. (This application only runs on Windows, "
"so you have to use a Windows machine or a Windows virtual machine with USB "
"support to update the controller's firmware.) After updating the "
"controller's firmware, unpair the controller and pair it again with your PC "
"if you are using the controller in wireless mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If buttons are incorrectly mapped, this may be due to an erroneous mapping "
"from the `SDL game controller database <https://github.com/gabomdq/"
"SDL_GameControllerDB>`__. You can contribute an updated mapping to be "
"included in the next Godot version by opening a pull request on the linked "
"repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are many ways to create mappings. One option is to use the mapping "
"wizard in the `official Joypads demo <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/"
"asset/140>`__. Once you have a working mapping for your controller, you can "
"test it by defining the ``SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG`` environment variable "
"before running Godot:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To test mappings on non-desktop platforms or to distribute your project with "
"additional controller mappings, you can add them by calling :ref:`Input."
"add_joy_mapping() <class_Input_method_add_joy_mapping>` as early as possible "
"in a script's ``_ready()`` function."

"If you're using a self-compiled engine binary, make sure it was compiled "
"with udev support. This is enabled by default, but it is possible to disable "
"udev support by specifying ``udev=no`` on the SCons command line. If you're "
"using an engine binary supplied by a Linux distribution, double-check "
"whether it was compiled with udev support."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Controllers can still work without udev support, but it is less reliable as "
"regular polling must be used to check for controllers being connected or "
"disconnected during gameplay (hotplugging)."
msgstr ""

msgid "HTML5"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"HTML5 controller support is often less reliable compared to \"native\" "
"platforms. The quality of controller support tends to vary wildly across "
