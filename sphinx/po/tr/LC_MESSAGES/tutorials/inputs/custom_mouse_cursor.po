msgid "Customizing the mouse cursor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You might want to change the appearance of the mouse cursor in your game in "
"order to suit the overall design. There are two ways to customize the mouse "
"cursor:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using project settings"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using a script"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using project settings is a simpler (but more limited) way to customize the "
"mouse cursor. The second way is more customizable, but involves scripting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You could display a \"software\" mouse cursor by hiding the mouse cursor and "
"moving a Sprite2D to the cursor position in a ``_process()`` method, but "
"this will add at least one frame of latency compared to an \"hardware\" "
"mouse cursor. Therefore, it's recommended to use the approach described here "
"whenever possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have to use the \"software\" approach, consider adding an "
"extrapolation step to better display the actual mouse input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open project settings, go to Display>Mouse Cursor. You will see Custom "
"Image, Custom Image Hotspot and Tooltip Position Offset."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Custom Image is the desired image that you would like to set as the mouse "
"cursor. Custom Hotspot is the point in the image that you would like to use "
"as the cursor's detection point."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The custom image **must** be 256×256 pixels at most. To avoid rendering "
"issues, sizes lower than or equal to 128×128 are recommended."
msgstr ""

msgid "On the web platform, the maximum allowed cursor image size is 128×128."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a Node and attach the following script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Check :ref:`Input.set_custom_mouse_cursor() "
"<class_Input_method_set_custom_mouse_cursor>`'s documentation for more "
"information on usage and platform-specific caveats."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cursor list"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As documented in the :ref:`Input <class_Input>` class (see the "
"**CursorShape** enum), there are multiple mouse cursors you can define. "
"Which ones you want to use depends on your use case."
