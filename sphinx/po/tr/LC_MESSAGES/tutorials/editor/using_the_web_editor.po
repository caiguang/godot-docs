msgid "Using the Web editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since Godot 3.3, there is a `Web editor <https://editor.godotengine.org/>`__ "
"you can use to work on new or existing projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The web editor is in a preliminary stage. While its feature set may be "
"sufficient for educational purposes, it is currently **not recommended for "
"production work**. See :ref:`doc_using_the_web_editor_limitations` below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Browser support"
msgstr "Tarayıcı desteği"

msgid ""
"The Web editor requires support for WebAssembly's SharedArrayBuffer. This is "
"in turn required to support threading in the browser. The following desktop "
"browsers support WebAssembly threading and can therefore run the web editor:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Chrome 68 or later"
msgstr ""

msgid "Firefox 79 or later"
msgstr ""

msgid "Edge 79 or later"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Opera and Safari are not supported yet. Safari may work in the future once "
"proper threading support is added."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Mobile browsers are currently not supported.**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The web editor only supports the Compatibility rendering method, as there is "
"no stable way to run Vulkan applications on the web yet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you use Linux, due to `poor Firefox WebGL performance <https://bugzilla."
"mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1010527>`__, it's recommended to use a Chromium-"
"based browser instead of Firefox."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limitations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to limitations on the Godot or Web platform side, the following features "
"are currently missing:"
msgstr ""

msgid "No C#/Mono support."
msgstr "C#/Mono desteği yok."

#, fuzzy
msgid "No GDExtension support."
msgstr "C#/Mono desteği yok."

msgid ""
"No debugging support. This means GDScript debugging/profiling, live scene "
"editing, the Remote Scene tree dock and other features that rely on the "
"debugger protocol will not work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No project exporting. As a workaround, you can download the project source "
"using **Project > Tools > Download Project Source** and export it using a "
"`native version of the Godot editor <https://godotengine.org/download>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid "The editor won't warn you when closing the tab with unsaved changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No lightmap baking support. You can still use existing lightmaps if they "
"were baked with a native version of the Godot editor (e.g. by importing an "
"existing project)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following features are unlikely to be supported due to inherent "
"limitations of the Web platform:"
msgstr ""

msgid "No support for external script editors."
msgstr "Harici betik düzenleyiciler için destek yok."

msgid "No support for Android one-click deploy."
msgstr "Android tek-tıkla dağıtım desteği yok."

msgid ""
"See the `list of open issues on GitHub related to the web editor <https://"
"github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?"
"q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aplatform%3Ahtml5+label%3Atopic%3Aeditor>`__ "
"for a list of known bugs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Importing a project"
msgstr ""

msgid "To import an existing project, the current process is as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specify a ZIP file to preload on the HTML5 filesystem using the **Preload "
"project ZIP** input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run the editor by clicking **Start Godot editor**. The Godot Project Manager "
"should appear after 10-20 seconds. On slower machines or connections, "
"loading may take up to a minute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the dialog that appears at the middle of the window, specify a name for "
"the folder to create then click the **Create Folder** button (it doesn't "
"have to match the ZIP archive's name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click **Install & Edit** and the project will open in the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's important to place the project folder somewhere in ``/home/web_user/``. "
"If your project folder is placed outside ``/home/web_user/``, you will lose "
"your project when closing the editor!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you follow the steps described above, the project folder will always be "
"located in ``/home/web_user/projects``, keeping it safe."
msgstr ""

msgid "Editing and running a project"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike the native version of Godot, the web editor is constrained to a "
"single window. Therefore, it cannot open a new window when running the "
"project. Instead, when you run the project by clicking the Run button or "
"pressing :kbd:`F5`, it will appear to \"replace\" the editor window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The web editor offers an alternative way to deal with the editor and game "
"windows (which are now \"tabs\"). You can switch between the **Editor** and "
"**Game** tabs using the buttons on the top. You can also close the running "
"game or editor by clicking the **×** button next to those tabs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Where are my project files?"
msgstr "Proje dosyalarım nerede?"

msgid ""
"Due to browser security limitations, the editor will save the project files "
"to the browser's IndexedDB storage. This storage isn't accessible as a "
"regular folder on your machine, but is abstracted away in a database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can download the project files as a ZIP archive by using **Project > "
"Tools > Download Project Source**. This can be used to export the project "
"using a `native Godot editor <https://godotengine.org/download>`__, since "
"exporting from the web editor isn't supported yet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the future, it may be possible to use the `HTML5 FileSystem API <https://"
"developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem>`__ to store the project "
"files on the user's filesystem as the native editor would do. However, this "
"isn't implemented yet."
