"Some developers like using the command line extensively. Godot is designed "
"to be friendly to them, so here are the steps for working entirely from the "
"command line. Given the engine relies on almost no external libraries, "
"initialization times are pretty fast, making it suitable for this workflow."

msgid ""
"On Windows and Linux, you can run a Godot binary in a terminal by specifying "
"its relative or absolute path."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On macOS, the process is different due to Godot being contained within an ``."
"app`` bundle (which is a *folder*, not a file). To run a Godot binary from a "
"terminal on macOS, you have to ``cd`` to the folder where the Godot "
"application bundle is located, then run ``Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`` "
"followed by any command line arguments. If you've renamed the application "
"bundle from ``Godot`` to another name, make sure to edit this command line "
"accordingly."
