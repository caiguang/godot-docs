"Particle shaders are a special type of shader that runs before the object is "
"drawn. They are used for calculating material properties such as color, "
"position, and rotation. They are drawn with any regular material for "
"CanvasItem or Spatial, depending on whether they are 2D or 3D."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Particle shaders are unique because they are not used to draw the object "
"itself; they are used to calculate particle properties, which are then used "
"by a CanvasItem or Spatial shader. They contain two processor functions: "
"``start()`` and ``process()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike other shader types, particle shaders keep the data that was output "
"the previous frame. Therefore, particle shaders can be used for complex "
"effects that take place over multiple frames."

"CPU-based particle nodes (:ref:`class_CPUParticles2D` and :ref:"
"`class_CPUParticles3D`) are *rendered* on the GPU (which means they can use "
"custom CanvasItem or Spatial shaders), but their motion is *simulated* on "
