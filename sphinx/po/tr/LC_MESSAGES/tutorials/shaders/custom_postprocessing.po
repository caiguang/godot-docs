msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Giriş"

msgid ""
"Godot provides many post-processing effects out of the box, including Bloom, "
"DOF, and SSAO, which are described in :ref:"
"`doc_environment_and_post_processing`. However, advanced use cases may "
"require custom effects. This article explains how to write your own custom "
"effects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The easiest way to implement a custom post-processing shader is to use "
"Godot's built-in ability to read from the screen texture. If you're not "
"familiar with this, you should read the :ref:`Screen Reading Shaders "
"Tutorial <doc_screen-reading_shaders>` first."
msgstr ""

msgid "Single pass post-processing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Post-processing effects are shaders applied to a frame after Godot has "
"rendered it. To apply a shader to a frame, create a :ref:`CanvasLayer "
"<class_CanvasLayer>`, and give it a :ref:`ColorRect <class_ColorRect>`. "
"Assign a new :ref:`ShaderMaterial <class_ShaderMaterial>` to the newly "
"created ``ColorRect``, and set the ``ColorRect``'s layout to \"Full Rect\"."

msgid "Your scene tree will look something like this:"
msgstr "Şimdi sahneniz bunun gibi bir şeye benzemelidir:"

msgid ""
"Another more efficient method is to use a :ref:`BackBufferCopy "
"<class_BackBufferCopy>` to copy a region of the screen to a buffer and to "
"access it in a shader script through a ``sampler2D`` using "
"``hint_screen_texture``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As of the time of writing, Godot does not support rendering to multiple "
"buffers at the same time. Your post-processing shader will not have access "
"to other render passes and buffers not exposed by Godot (such as depth or "
"normal/roughness). You only have access to the rendered frame and buffers "
"exposed by Godot as samplers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this demo, we will use this :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite2D>` of a sheep."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assign a new :ref:`Shader <class_Shader>` to the ``ColorRect``'s "
"``ShaderMaterial``. You can access the frame's texture and UV with a "
"``sampler2D`` using ``hint_screen_texture`` and the built in ``SCREEN_UV`` "
"uniforms."

"Copy the following code to your shader. The code below is a hex pixelization "

msgid "Multi-pass post-processing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some post-processing effects like blurs are resource intensive. You can make "
"them run a lot faster if you break them down in multiple passes. In a "
"multipass material, each pass takes the result from the previous pass as an "
"input and processes it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To produce a multi-pass post-processing shader, you stack ``CanvasLayer`` "
"and ``ColorRect`` nodes. In the example above, you use a ``CanvasLayer`` "
"object to render a shader using the frame on the layer below. Apart from the "
"node structure, the steps are the same as with the single-pass post-"
"processing shader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an example, you could write a full screen Gaussian blur effect by "
"attaching the following pieces of code to each of the ``ColorRect`` nodes. "
"The order in which you apply the shaders depends on the position of the "
"``CanvasLayer`` in the scene tree, higher means sooner. For this blur "
"shader, the order does not matter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using the above code, you should end up with a full screen blur effect like "
"below."
