":ref:`GDScript<doc_gdscript>` is a high-level, `object-oriented <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>`_, `imperative <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming>`_, and `gradually typed <https://"
"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing>`_ programming language built for "
"Godot. It uses an indentation-based syntax similar to languages like `Python "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29>`_. Its "
"goal is to be optimized for and tightly integrated with Godot Engine, "
