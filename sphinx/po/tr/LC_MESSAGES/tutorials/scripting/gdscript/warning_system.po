"The GDScript warning system complements :ref:`static typing "
"<doc_gdscript_static_typing>` (but it can work without static typing too). "
"It's here to help you avoid mistakes that are hard to spot during "
"development, and that may lead to runtime errors."

"You can configure warnings in the Project Settings under the section called "
"**GDScript**:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You must enable **Advanced Settings** in order to see the GDScript section "
"in the sidebar. You can also search for \"GDScript\" when Advanced Settings "
"is off."

msgid ""
"You can find a list of warnings for the active GDScript file in the script "
"editor's status bar. The example below has 2 warnings:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To ignore specific warnings in one file, insert an annotation of the form "
"``@warning_ignore(\"warning-id\")``, or click on the ignore link to the left "
"of the warning's description. Godot will add an annotation above the "
"corresponding line and the code won't trigger the corresponding warning "
"anymore:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Warnings won't prevent the game from running, but you can turn them into "
"errors if you'd like. This way your game won't compile unless you fix all "
"warnings. Head to the ``GDScript`` section of the Project Settings to turn "
"on this option to the warning that you want. Here's the same file as the "
"previous example with the warning ``unused_variable`` as an error turned on:"
