"is represented as a string, which can refer to many of the following:"

msgid "Platform name."

msgid "Platform architecture (64-bit or 32-bit, x86 or ARM)."

msgid "Platform type (desktop, mobile, Web)."

msgid "Supported texture compression algorithms on the platform."

"Whether a build is ``debug`` or ``release`` (``debug`` includes the editor)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whether the project is running from the editor or a \"standalone\" binary."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many more things."

msgid "Features can be queried at run-time from the singleton API by calling:"

msgid ""
"OS feature tags are used by GDExtension to determine which libraries to "
"load. For example, a library for ``linux.debug.editor.x86_64`` will be "

"With the exception of texture compression and ``movie`` feature tags, "
