msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Giriş"

msgid ""
"This is an overview of the 2D transforms going on for nodes from the moment "
"they draw their content locally to the time they are drawn onto the screen. "
"This overview discusses very low level details of the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The goal of this tutorial is to teach a way for feeding input events to the "
"Input with a position in the correct coordinate system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A more extensive description of all coordinate systems and 2d transforms is "
"available in :ref:`doc_2d_coordinate_systems`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Canvas transform"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the previous tutorial, :ref:`doc_canvas_layers`, every "
"CanvasItem node (remember that Node2D and Control based nodes use CanvasItem "
"as their common root) will reside in a *Canvas Layer*. Every canvas layer "
"has a transform (translation, rotation, scale, etc.) that can be accessed as "
"a :ref:`Transform2D <class_Transform2D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also covered in the previous tutorial, nodes are drawn by default in Layer "
"0, in the built-in canvas. To put nodes in a different layer, a :ref:"
"`CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>` node can be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Global canvas transform"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Viewports also have a Global Canvas transform (also a :ref:`Transform2D "
"<class_Transform2D>`). This is the master transform and affects all "
"individual *Canvas Layer* transforms. Generally, this is primarily used in "
"Godot's CanvasItem Editor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stretch transform"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, viewports have a *Stretch Transform*, which is used when resizing "
"or stretching the screen. This transform is used internally (as described "
"in :ref:`doc_multiple_resolutions`), but can also be manually set on each "
"viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Input events are multiplied by this transform but lack the ones above. To "
"convert InputEvent coordinates to local CanvasItem coordinates, the :ref:"
"`CanvasItem.make_input_local() <class_CanvasItem_method_make_input_local>` "
"function was added for convenience."
msgstr ""

msgid "Window transform"
msgstr "2B dönüştürmeleri kullanmak"

msgid ""
"The root viewport is a :ref:`Window <class_Window>`. In order to scale and "
"position the *Window's* content as described in :ref:"
"`doc_multiple_resolutions`, each :ref:`Window <class_Window>` contains a "
"*window transform*. It is for example responsible for the black bars at the "
"*Window's* sides so that the *Viewport* is displayed with a fixed aspect "
"ratio."
msgstr ""

msgid "Transform order"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To convert a CanvasItem local coordinate to an actual screen coordinate, the "
"following chain of transforms must be applied:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Transform functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above graphic shows some available transform functions. All transforms "
"are directed from right to left, this means multiplying a transform with a "
"coordinate results in a coordinate system further to the left, multiplying "
"the :ref:`affine inverse <class_Transform2D_method_affine_inverse>` of a "
"transform results in a coordinate system further to the right:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, then, to convert a CanvasItem local coordinates to screen "
"coordinates, just multiply in the following order:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind, however, that it is generally not desired to work with screen "
"coordinates. The recommended approach is to simply work in Canvas "
"coordinates (``CanvasItem.get_global_transform()``), to allow automatic "
"screen resolution resizing to work properly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Feeding custom input events"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is often desired to feed custom input events to the game. With the above "
"knowledge, to correctly do this in the focused window, it must be done the "
"following way:"
