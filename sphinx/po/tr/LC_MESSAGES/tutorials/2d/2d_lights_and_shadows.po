"By default, 2D scenes in Godot are unshaded, with no lights and shadows "
"visible. While this is fast to render, unshaded scenes can look bland. Godot "
"provides the ability to use real-time 2D lighting and shadows, which can "
"greatly enhance the sense of depth in your project."

":ref:`CanvasModulate <class_CanvasModulate>` is used to darken the scene by "
"specifying a color that will act as the base \"ambient\" color. This is the "
"final lighting color in areas that are *not* reached by any 2D light. "
"Without a CanvasModulate node, the final scene would look too bright as 2D "
"lights would only brighten the existing unshaded appearance (which appears "

":ref:`Sprite2Ds <class_Sprite2D>` are used to display the textures for the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`PointLight2Ds <class_PointLight2D>` are used to light the scene. The "
"way a light typically works is by adding a selected texture over the rest of "
"the scene to simulate lighting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`LightOccluder2Ds <class_LightOccluder2D>` are used to tell the shader "

msgid "Point lights"
msgstr "Ortamsal Işık"

msgid ""
"Point lights (also called positional lights) are the most common element in "
"2D lighting. Point lights can be used to represent light from torches, fire, "
"projectiles, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid "PointLight2D offers the following properties to tweak in the inspector:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Texture:** The texture to use as a light source. The texture's size "
"determines the size of the light. The texture may have an alpha channel, "
"which is useful when using Light2D's **Mix** blend mode, but it is not "
"required if using the **Add** (default) or **Subtract** blend modes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Offset:** The offset for the light texture. Unlike when you move the light "
"node, changing the offset does *not* cause shadows to move."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Texture Scale:** The multiplier for the light's size. Higher values will "
"make the light extend out further. Larger lights have a higher performance "
"cost as they affect more pixels on screen, so consider this before "
"increasing a light's size."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Height:** The light's virtual height with regards to normal mapping. By "
"default, the light is very close to surfaces receiving lights. This will "
"make lighting hardly visible if normal mapping is used, so consider "
"increasing this value. Adjusting the light's height only makes a visible "
"difference on surfaces that use normal mapping."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't have a pre-made texture to use in a light, you can use this "
"\"neutral\" point light texture (right-click > **Save Image As…**):"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Neutral point light texture"
msgstr "Dokuları okumak"

msgid ""
"If you need different falloff, you can procedurally create a texture by "
"assigning a **New GradientTexture2D** on the light's **Texture** property. "
"After creating the resource, expand its **Fill** section and set the fill "
"mode to **Radial**. You will then have to adjust the gradient itself to "
"start from opaque white to transparent white, and move its starting location "
"to be in the center."
msgstr ""

msgid "Directional light"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"New in Godot 4.0 is the ability to have directional lighting in 2D. "
"Directional lighting is used to represent sunlight or moonlight. Light rays "
"are casted parallel to each other, as if the sun or moon was infinitely far "
"away from the surface that is receiving the light."
msgstr ""

msgid "DirectionalLight2D offers the following properties:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Height:** The light's virtual height with regards to normal mapping "
"(``0.0`` = parallel to surfaces, ``1.0`` = perpendicular to surfaces). By "
"default, the light is fully parallel with the surfaces receiving lights. "
"This will make lighting hardly visible if normal mapping is used, so "
"consider increasing this value. Adjusting the light's height only makes a "
"visual difference on surfaces that use normal mapping. **Height** does not "
"affect shadows' appearance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Max Distance:** The maximum distance from the camera center objects can be "
"before their shadows are culled (in pixels). Decreasing this value can "
"prevent objects located outside the camera from casting shadows (while also "
"improving performance). Camera2D zoom is not taken into account by **Max "
"Distance**, which means that at higher zoom values, shadows will appear to "
"fade out sooner when zooming onto a given point."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Directional shadows will always appear to be infinitely long, regardless of "
"the value of the **Height** property. This is a limitation of the shadow "
"rendering method used for 2D lights in Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To have directional shadows that are not infinitely long, you should disable "
"shadows in the DirectionalLight2D and use a custom shader that reads from "
"the 2D signed distance field instead. This distance field is automatically "
"generated from LightOccluder2D nodes present in the scene."

msgid "Common light properties"
msgstr "Düzenlenebilir özellikler."

msgid ""
"Both PointLight2D and DirectionalLight2D offer common properties, which are "
"part of the Light2D base class:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Enabled:** Allows toggling the light's visibility. Unlike hiding the light "
"node, disabling this property will not hide the light's children."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Editor Only:** If enabled, the light is only visible within the editor. It "
"will be automatically disabled in the running project."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Color:** The light's color."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Energy:** The light's intensity multiplier. Higher values result in a "
"brighter light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Blend Mode:** The blending formula used for light computations. The "
"default **Add** is suited for most use cases. **Subtract** can be used for "
"negative lights, which are not physically accurate but can be used for "
"special effects. The **Mix** blend mode mixes the value of pixels "
"corresponding to the light's texture with the values of pixels under it by "
"linear interpolation."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Range > Z Min:** The lowest Z index affected by the light."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Range > Z Max:** The highest Z index affected by the light."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Range > Layer Min:** The lowest visual layer affected by the light."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Range > Layer Max:** The highest visual layer affected by the light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Range > Item Cull Mask:** Controls which nodes receive light from this "
"node, depending on the other nodes' enabled visual layers **Occluder Light "
"Mask**. This can be used to prevent certain objects from receiving light."

msgid "Setting up shadows"
msgstr "Projeyi ayarlamak"

msgid ""
"After enabling the **Shadow > Enabled** property on a PointLight2D or "
"DirectionalLight2D node, you will not see any visual difference initially. "
"This is because no nodes in your scene have any *occluders* yet, which are "
"used as a basis for shadow casting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For shadows to appear in the scene, LightOccluder2D nodes must be added to "
"the scene. These nodes must also have occluder polygons that are designed to "
"match the sprite's outline."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Along with their polygon resource (which must be set to have any visual "
"effect), LightOccluder2D nodes have 2 properties:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**SDF Collision:** If enabled, the occluder will be part of a real-time "
"generated *signed distance field* that can be used in custom shaders. When "
"not using custom shaders that read from this SDF, enabling this makes no "
"visual difference and has no performance cost, so this is enabled by default "
"for convenience."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Occluder Light Mask:** This is used in tandem with PointLight2D and "
"DirectionalLight2D's **Shadow > Item Cull Mask** property to control which "
"objects cast shadows for each light. This can be used to prevent specific "
"objects from casting shadows."

"In the dialog that appears, an outline will surround your sprite's edges. If "
"the outline matches the sprite's edges closely, you can click **OK**. If the "
"outline is too far away from the sprite's edges (or is \"eating\" into the "
"sprite's edges), adjust **Grow (pixels)** and **Shrink (pixels)**, then "

"then dragging."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following properties can be adjusted on 2D lights that have shadows "
"enabled:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Color:** The color of shaded areas. By default, shaded areas are fully "
"black, but this can be changed for artistic purposes. The color's alpha "
"channel controls how much the shadow is tinted by the specified color."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Filter:** The filter mode to use for shadows. The default **None** is the "
"fastest to render, and is well suited for games with a pixel art aesthetic "
"(due to its \"blocky\" visuals). If you want a soft shadow, use **PCF5** "
"instead. **PCF13** is even softer, but is the most demanding to render. "
"PCF13 should only be used for a few lights at once due to its high rendering "
"cost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Filter Smooth:** Controls how much softening is applied to shadows when "
"**Filter** is set to **PCF5** or **PCF13**. Higher values result in a softer "
"shadow, but may cause banding artifacts to be visible (especially with PCF5)."

msgid ""
"**LightOccluder2Ds follows the usual 2D drawing order.** This is important "

msgstr ""

msgid "Normal and specular maps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normal maps and specular maps can greatly enhance the sense of depth of your "
"2D lighting. Similar to how these work in 3D rendering, normal maps can help "
"make lighting look less flat by varying its intensity depending on the "
"direction of the surface receiving light (on a per-pixel basis). Specular "
"maps further help improve visuals by making some of the light reflect back "
"to the viewer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both PointLight2D and DirectionalLight2D support normal mapping and specular "
"mapping. Since Godot 4.0, normal and specular maps can be assigned to any 2D "
"element, including nodes that inherit from Node2D or Control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A normal map represents the direction in which each pixel is \"pointing\" "
"towards. This information is then used by the engine to correctly apply "
"lighting to 2D surfaces in a physically plausible way. Normal maps are "
"typically created from hand-painted height maps, but they can also be "
"automatically generated from other textures."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A specular map defines how much each pixel should reflect light (and in "
"which color, if the specular map contains color). Brighter values will "
"result in a brighter reflection at that given spot on the texture. Specular "
"maps are typically created with manual editing, using the diffuse texture as "
"a base."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't have normal or specular maps for your sprites, you can generate "
"them using the free and open source `Laigter <https://azagaya.itch.io/"

"**Diffuse > Texture:** The base color texture. In this property, load the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Normal Map > Texture:** The normal map texture. In this property, load a "
"normal map texture you've generated from a height map (see the tip above)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Specular > Texture:** The specular map texture, which controls the "
"specular intensity of each pixel on the diffuse texture. The specular map is "
"usually grayscale, but it can also contain color to multiply the color of "
"reflections accordingly. In this property, load a specular map texture "
"you've created (see the tip above)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Specular > Color:** The color multiplier for specular reflections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Specular > Shininess:** The specular exponent to use for reflections. "
"Lower values will increase the brightness of reflections and make them more "
"diffuse, while higher values will make reflections more localized. High "
"values are more suited for wet-looking surfaces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Texture > Filter:** Can be set to override the texture filtering mode, "
"regardless of what the node's property is set to (or the **Rendering > "
"Textures > Canvas Textures > Default Texture Filter** project setting)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Texture > Repeat:** Can be set to override the texture filtering mode, "
"regardless of what the node's property is set to (or the **Rendering > "
"Textures > Canvas Textures > Default Texture Repeat** project setting)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After enabling normal mapping, you may notice that your lights appear to be "
"weaker. To resolve this, increase the **Height** property on your "
"PointLight2D and DirectionalLight2D nodes. You may also want to increase the "
"lights's **Energy** property slightly to get closer to how your lighting's "
"intensity looked prior to enabling normal mapping."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using additive sprites as a faster alternative to 2D lights"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you run into performance issues when using 2D lights, it may be worth "
"replacing some of them with Sprite2D nodes that use additive blending. This "
"is particularly suited for short-lived dynamic effects, such as bullets or "
"explosions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additive sprites are much faster to render, since they don't need to go "
"through a separate rendering pipeline. Additionally, it is possible to use "
"this approach with AnimatedSprite2D (or Sprite2D + AnimationPlayer), which "
"allows for animated 2D \"lights\" to be created."
msgstr ""

msgid "However, additive sprites have a few downsides compared to 2D lights:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The blending formula is inaccurate compared to \"actual\" 2D lighting. This "
"is usually not a problem in sufficiently lit areas, but this prevents "
"additive sprites from correctly lighting up areas that are fully dark."

msgstr ""

msgid "Additive sprites ignore normal and specular maps used on other sprites."
msgstr ""
