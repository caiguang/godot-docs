msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Giriş"

msgid ""
"Every beginner has been there: \"How do I move my character?\" Depending on "
"the style of game you're making, you may have special requirements, but in "
"general the movement in most 2D games is based on a small number of designs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We'll use :ref:`CharacterBody2D <class_CharacterBody2D>` for these examples, "
"but the principles will apply to other node types (Area2D, RigidBody2D) as "
"well."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setup"
msgstr "Kurulum"

msgid ""
"Each example below uses the same scene setup. Start with a "
"``CharacterBody2D`` with two children: ``Sprite2D`` and "
"``CollisionShape2D``. You can use the Godot icon (\"icon.png\") for the "
"Sprite2D's texture or use any other 2D image you have."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open ``Project -> Project Settings`` and select the \"Input Map\" tab. Add "
"the following input actions (see :ref:`InputEvent <doc_inputevent>` for "
"details):"
msgstr ""

msgid "8-way movement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this scenario, you want the user to press the four directional keys (up/"
"left/down/right or W/A/S/D) and move in the selected direction. The name \"8-"
"way movement\" comes from the fact that the player can move diagonally by "
"pressing two keys at the same time."

msgid "Add a script to the character body and add the following code:"
msgstr "Sahne -> Yeni Sahne 'ye tıklayın, ve aşağıdaki düğümleri ekleyin:"

msgid ""
"In the ``get_input()`` function, we use :ref:`Input <class_Input>` "
"``get_vector()`` to check for the four key events and sum return a direction "
"vector."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can then set our velocity by multiplying this direction vector, which has "
"a length of ``1``, by our desired speed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you've never used vector math before, or need a refresher, you can see an "
"explanation of vector usage in Godot at :ref:`doc_vector_math`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the code above does nothing when you press the keys, double-check that "
"you've set up input actions correctly as described in the :ref:"
"`doc_2d_movement_setup` part of this tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rotation + movement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This type of movement is sometimes called \"Asteroids-style\" because it "
"resembles how that classic arcade game worked. Pressing left/right rotates "
"the character, while up/down moves it forward or backward in whatever "
"direction it's facing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here we've added two variables to track our rotation direction and speed. "
"The rotation is applied directly to the body's ``rotation`` property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To set the velocity, we use the body's ``transform.x`` which is a vector "
"pointing in the body's \"forward\" direction, and multiply that by the speed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rotation + movement (mouse)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This style of movement is a variation of the previous one. This time, the "
"direction is set by the mouse position instead of the keyboard. The "
"character will always \"look at\" the mouse pointer. The forward/back inputs "
"remain the same, however."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here we're using the :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` ``look_at()`` method to "
"point the player towards the mouse's position. Without this function, you "
"could get the same effect by setting the angle like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Click-and-move"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This last example uses only the mouse to control the character. Clicking on "
"the screen will cause the player to move to the target location."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note the ``distance_to()`` check we make prior to movement. Without this "
"test, the body would \"jitter\" upon reaching the target position, as it "
"moves slightly past the position and tries to move back, only to move too "
"far and repeat."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Uncommenting the ``look_at()`` line will also turn the body to point in its "
"direction of motion if you prefer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This technique can also be used as the basis of a \"following\" character. "
"The ``target`` position can be that of any object you want to move to."
msgstr ""

"projects. Feel free to use them and experiment with them to see what you can "
"make."
