"Godot Engine allows to write unit tests directly in C++. The engine "
"integrates the `doctest <https://github.com/onqtam/doctest>`_ unit testing "
"framework which gives ability to write test suites and test cases next to "
"production code, but since the tests in Godot go through a different "
"``main`` entry point, the tests reside in a dedicated ``tests/`` directory "
"instead, which is located at the root of the engine source code."

"Tests are compiled automatically if you use the ``dev_mode=yes`` SCons "
"option. ``dev_mode=yes`` is recommended if you plan on contributing to the "
"engine development as it will automatically treat compilation warnings as "
"errors. The continuous integration system will fail if any compilation "
"warnings are detected, so you should strive to fix all warnings before "

"The ``tests/test_macros.h`` header encapsulates everything which is needed "

"Test cases are created using ``TEST_CASE`` function-like macro. Each test "

"``[String]``, ``[Stress]`` etc."
msgstr ""

"Test cases are written in a dedicated namespace. This is not required, but "

msgid "Testing failure paths"
msgstr "Çevirileri test etmek"

msgid ""
"Sometimes, it's not always feasible to test for an *expected* result. With "
"the Godot development philosophy of that the engine should not crash and "
"should gracefully recover whenever a non-fatal error occurs, it's important "
"to check that those failure paths are indeed safe to execute without "
"crashing the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Unexpected* behavior can be tested in the same way as anything else. The "
"only problem this creates is that the error printing shall unnecessarily "
"pollute the test output with errors coming from the engine itself (even if "
"the end result is successful)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To alleviate this problem, use ``ERR_PRINT_OFF`` and ``ERR_PRINT_ON`` macros "
"directly within test cases to temporarily disable the error output coming "
"from the engine, for instance:"

msgid ""
"Test tools are advanced methods which allow you to run arbitrary procedures "
"to facilitate the process of manual testing and debugging the engine "
"internals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These tools can be run by supplying the name of a tool after the ``--test`` "
"command-line option. For instance, the GDScript module implements and "
"registers several tools to help the debugging of the tokenizer, parser, and "
"compiler:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If any such tool is detected, then the rest of the unit tests are skipped."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Test tools can be registered anywhere throughout the engine as the "
"registering mechanism closely resembles of what doctest provides while "
"registering test cases using dynamic initialization technique, but usually "
"these can be registered at corresponding ``register_types.cpp`` sources (per "
"module or core)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here's an example of how GDScript registers test tools in ``modules/gdscript/"
"register_types.cpp``:"

msgid ""
"Therefore, the process of writing integration tests for GDScript is the "
"following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pick a type of a test script you'd like to write, and create a new GDScript "
"file under the ``modules/gdscript/tests/scripts`` directory within "
"corresponding sub-directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Write GDScript code. The test script must have a function called ``test()`` "
"which takes no arguments. Such function will be called by the test runner. "
"The test should not have any dependency unless it's part of the test too. "
"Global classes (using ``class_name``) are registered before the runner "
"starts, so those should work if needed."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Change directory to the Godot source repository root."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generate ``*.out`` files to update the expected results from the output:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may add the ``--print-filenames`` option to see filenames as their test "
"outputs are generated. If you are working on a new feature that is causing "
"hard crashes, you can use this option to quickly find which test file causes "
"the crash and debug from there."
msgstr ""

msgid "This also accepts the ``--print-filenames`` option (see above)."
msgstr ""

msgid "If no errors are printed and everything goes well, you're done!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure the output does have the expected values before submitting a pull "
"request. If ``--gdscript-generate-tests`` produces ``*.out`` files which are "
"unrelated to newly added tests, you should revert those files back and only "
"commit ``*.out`` files for new tests."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GDScript test runner is meant for testing the GDScript implementation, "
"not for testing user scripts nor testing the engine using scripts. We "
"recommend writing new tests for already resolved `issues related to GDScript "
"at GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?"
"q=is%3Aissue+label%3Atopic%3Agdscript+is%3Aclosed>`_, or writing tests for "
"currently working features."

msgid ""
"If your test case requires that there is no ``test()`` function present "
"inside the script file, you can disable the runtime section of the test by "
"naming the script file so that it matches the pattern ``*.notest.gd``. For "
"example, \"test_empty_file.notest.gd\"."
