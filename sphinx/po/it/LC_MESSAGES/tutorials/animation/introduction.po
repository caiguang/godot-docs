"AnimationPlayer inherits from Node instead of Node2D or Node3D, which means "

"Godot has an interesting feature that we can use in animations. When "
"Animation Looping is set but there's no keyframe specified at the end of the "
"animation, the first keyframe is also the last."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means we can extend the animation length to four seconds now, and Godot "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Capture:** if the first keyframe's time is greater than ``0.0``, the "

msgid "Track interpolation"
msgstr "Interpolazione traccia"

msgid ""
"With Cubic interpolation, animation is slower at keyframes and faster "
"between them, which leads to more natural movement. Cubic interpolation is "
"commonly used for character animation. Linear interpolation animates changes "

"animation after the last keyframe to reach the values of the first keyframe "
"again."

"Godot's animation system isn't restricted to position, rotation, and scale. "

msgid "Using RESET tracks"

msgid ""
"You can set up a special *RESET* animation to contain the \"default pose\". "
"This is used to ensure that the default pose is restored when you save the "
"scene and open it again in the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For existing tracks, you can add an animation called \"RESET\" (case-"
"sensitive), then add tracks for each property that you want to reset. The "
"only keyframe should be at time 0, and give it the desired default value for "
"each track."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If AnimationPlayer's **Reset On Save** property is set to ``true``, the "
"scene will be saved with the effects of the reset animation applied (as if "
"it had been seeked to time ``0.0``). This only affects the saved file – the "
"property tracks in the editor stay where they were."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to reset the tracks in the editor, select the AnimationPlayer "
"node, open the **Animation** bottom panel then choose **Apply Reset** in the "
"animation editor's **Edit** dropdown menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When adding tracks on new animations, the editor will ask you to "
"automatically create a RESET track when using the keyframe icon next to a "
"property in the inspector. This does not apply on tracks created with Godot "
"versions prior to 3.4, as the animation reset track feature was added in 3.4."
