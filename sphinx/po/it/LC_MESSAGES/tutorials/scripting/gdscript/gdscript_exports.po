"In Godot, class members can be exported. This means their value gets saved "
"along with the resource (such as the :ref:`scene <class_PackedScene>`) "
"they're attached to. They will also be available for editing in the property "
"editor. Exporting is done by using the ``@export`` annotation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In that example the value ``5`` will be saved and visible in the property "
"editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An exported variable must be initialized to a constant expression or have a "
"type specifier in the variable. Some of the export annotations have a "
"specific type and don't need the variable to be typed (see the *Examples* "
"section below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the fundamental benefits of exporting member variables is to have "
"them visible and editable in the editor. This way, artists and game "
"designers can modify values that later influence how the program runs. For "
"this, a special export syntax is provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exporting properties can also be done in other languages such as C#. The "
"syntax varies depending on the language. See :ref:`doc_c_sharp_exports` for "

msgid ""
"It is possible to group your exported properties inside the Inspector with "
"the :ref:`@export_group <class_@GDScript_annotation_@export_group>` "
"annotation. Every exported property after this annotation will be added to "
"the group. Start a new group or use ``@export_group(\"\")`` to break out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second argument of the annotation can be used to only group properties "
"with the specified prefix."

msgid ""
"Groups cannot be nested, use :ref:`@export_subgroup "
"<class_@GDScript_annotation_@export_subgroup>` to create subgroups within a "
"group."

"You can also change the name of your main category, or create additional "

"<class_@GDScript_annotation_@export_category>` annotation."

"The list of properties is organized based on the class inheritance and new "
