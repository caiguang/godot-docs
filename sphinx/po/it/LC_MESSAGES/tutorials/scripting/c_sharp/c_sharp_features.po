"This page provides an overview of the commonly used features of both C# and "
"Godot and how they are used together."

msgid "Type conversion and casting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"C# is a statically typed language. Therefore, you can't do the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The method ``GetNode()`` returns a ``Node`` instance. You must explicitly "
"convert it to the desired derived type, ``Sprite2D`` in this case."
msgstr ""

msgid "For this, you have various options in C#."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Casting and Type Checking**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Throws ``InvalidCastException`` if the returned node cannot be cast to "
"Sprite2D. You would use it instead of the ``as`` operator if you are pretty "
"sure it won't fail."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "**Using the AS operator**"
msgstr "**Utilizzo dell'operatore AS**"

msgid ""
"The ``as`` operator returns ``null`` if the node cannot be cast to Sprite2D, "
"and for that reason, it cannot be used with value types."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "**Using the generic methods**"
msgstr "**Utilizzo dei metodi generici**"

msgid ""
"Generic methods are also provided to make this type conversion transparent."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``GetNode<T>()`` casts the node before returning it. It will throw an "
"``InvalidCastException`` if the node cannot be cast to the desired type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``GetNodeOrNull<T>()`` uses the ``as`` operator and will return ``null`` if "
"the node cannot be cast to the desired type."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Type checking using the IS operator**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check if the node can be cast to Sprite2D, you can use the ``is`` "
"operator. The ``is`` operator returns false if the node cannot be cast to "
"Sprite2D, otherwise it returns true. Note that when the ``is`` operator is "
"used against ``null`` the result is always going to be ``false``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also declare a new variable to conditionally store the result of the "
"cast if the ``is`` operator returns ``true``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more advanced type checking, you can look into `Pattern Matching "
"<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/pattern-matching>`_."

msgid "Preprocessor defines"
msgstr "Funzioni del processore"

msgid ""
"Godot has a set of defines that allow you to change your C# code depending "
"on the environment you are compiling to."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you created your project before Godot 3.2, you have to modify or "
"regenerate your `csproj` file to use this feature (compare "
"``<DefineConstants>`` with a new 3.2+ project)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples"
msgstr "Esempi"

msgid "For example, you can change code based on the platform:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or you can detect which engine your code is in, useful for making cross-"
"engine libraries:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or you can write scripts that target multiple Godot versions and take "
"advantage of features that are only available on some of those versions:"

msgid "Full list of defines"
msgstr "Elenco completo delle definizioni"

msgid "``GODOT`` is always defined for Godot projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``TOOLS`` is defined when building with the Debug configuration (editor and "
"editor player)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``GODOT_REAL_T_IS_DOUBLE`` is defined when the ``GodotFloat64`` property is "
"set to ``true``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of ``GODOT_64`` or ``GODOT_32`` is defined depending on if the "
"architecture is 64-bit or 32-bit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of ``GODOT_LINUXBSD``, ``GODOT_WINDOWS``, ``GODOT_OSX``, "
"``GODOT_ANDROID``, ``GODOT_IOS``, ``GODOT_HTML5``, or ``GODOT_SERVER`` "
"depending on the OS. These names may change in the future. These are created "
"from the ``get_name()`` method of the :ref:`OS <class_OS>` singleton, but "
"not every possible OS the method returns is an OS that Godot with .NET runs "
"on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``GODOTX``, ``GODOTX_Y``, ``GODOTX_Y_Z``, ``GODOTx_OR_GREATER``, "
"``GODOTX_y_OR_GREATER``, and ``GODOTX_Y_z_OR_GREATER``, where ``X``, ``Y``, "
"and ``Z`` are replaced by the current major, minor and patch version of "
"Godot. ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` are replaced by all values from 0 to the "
"current version number for that component."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These defines were first added in Godot 4.0.4 and 4.1. Version defines for "
"prior versions do not exist, regardless of the current Godot version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example: Godot 4.0.5 defines ``GODOT4``, ``GODOT4_OR_GREATER``, "
"``GODOT4_0``, ``GODOT4_0_OR_GREATER``, ``GODOT4_0_5``, "
"``GODOT4_0_4_OR_GREATER``, and ``GODOT4_0_5_OR_GREATER``. Godot 4.3.2 "
"defines ``GODOT4``, ``GODOT4_OR_GREATER``, ``GODOT4_3``, "
"``GODOT4_0_OR_GREATER``, ``GODOT4_1_OR_GREATER``, ``GODOT4_2_OR_GREATER``, "
"``GODOT4_3_OR_GREATER``, ``GODOT4_3_2``, ``GODOT4_3_0_OR_GREATER``, "
"``GODOT4_3_1_OR_GREATER``, and ``GODOT4_3_2_OR_GREATER``."

"When **exporting**, the following may also be defined depending on the "

msgid ""
"One of ``GODOT_PC``, ``GODOT_MOBILE``, or ``GODOT_WEB`` depending on the "
"platform type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of ``GODOT_WINDOWS``, ``GODOT_LINUXBSD``, ``GODOT_MACOS``, "
