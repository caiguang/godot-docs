"Godot provides a way to use script templates as seen in the ``Script Create "
"Dialog`` while creating a new script:"

"A set of built-in script templates are provided with the editor, but it is "
"also possible to create new ones and set them by default, both per project "
"and at editor scope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Templates are linked to a specific node type, so when you create a script "
"you will only see the templates corresponding to that particular node, or "
"one of its parent types. For example, if you are creating a script for a "
"CharacterBody3D, you will only see templates defined for CharacterBody3Ds, "
"Node3Ds or Nodes."

"The script templates have the same extension as the regular script files. "
"This may lead to an issue of a script parser treating those templates as "
"actual scripts within a project. To avoid this, make sure to ignore the "

"directory won't be visible throughout the project's filesystem anymore, yet "
"the templates can be modified by an external text editor anytime."

"By default, every C# file inside the project directory is included in the "
