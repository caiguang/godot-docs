"This page describes how to export a Godot project to Windows. If you're "
"looking to compile editor or export template binaries from source instead, "
"read :ref:`doc_compiling_for_windows`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The simplest way to distribute a game for PC is to copy the executable "
"(``godot.exe``), compress the folder and send it to someone else. However, "
"this is often not desired."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the "
"export system. When exporting for Windows, the exporter takes all the "
"project files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is bundled with a "
"specially optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does not contain the "
"editor and debugger."

msgid "Code signing"

msgid ""
"Godot is capable of automatic code signing on export. To do this you must "
"have the ``Windows SDK`` (on Windows) or `osslsigncode <https://github.com/"
"mtrojnar/osslsigncode>`__ (on any other OS) installed. You will also need a "
"package signing certificate, information on creating one can be found `here "
"<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/appxpkg/how-to-create-a-"
"package-signing-certificate?redirectedfrom=MSDN>`__."

msgid ""
"If you export for Windows with embedded PCK files, you will not be able to "
"sign the program as it will break."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, PCK embedding is also known to cause false positives in "
"antivirus programs. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using it unless "
"you're distributing your project via Steam as it bypasses code signing and "
"antivirus checks."

msgid "Setup"
msgstr "Configura"

msgid ""
"Settings need to be changed in two places. First, in the editor settings, "
"under **Export > Windows**. Click on the folder next to the ``Sign Tool`` "
"setting, if you're using Windows navigate to and select ``SignTool.exe``, if "
"you're on a different OS select ``osslsigncode``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second location is the Windows export preset, which can be found in "
"**Project > Export...**. Add a windows desktop preset if you haven't "
"already. Under options there is a code signing category."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Enabled`` must be set to true, and ``Identity`` must be set to the signing "
"certificate. The other settings can be adjusted as needed. Once this is Done "
"Godot will sign your project on export."
