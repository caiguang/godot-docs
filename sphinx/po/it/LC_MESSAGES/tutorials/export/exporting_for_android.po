"elements inside the safe zone: a centered circle with a diameter of 66dp "
"(264 pixels on ``xxxhdpi``) to avoid being clipped by the launcher."

"By default, the APK will contain native libraries for both ARMv7 and ARMv8 "
"architectures. This increases its size significantly. To create a smaller "
"APK, uncheck either **Armeabi-v 7a** or **Arm 64 -v 8a** in your project's "
"Android export preset. This will create an APK that only contains a library "

"run on ARMv8 devices, but the opposite is not true."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since August 2019, Google Play requires all applications to be available in "

"ARMv7 library. To solve this, you can upload several APKs to Google Play "
"using its `Multiple APK support <https://developer.android.com/google/play/"
