msgid "What is it?"
msgstr "Che cos'Ã¨?"

msgid ""
"Managing input is usually complex, no matter the OS or platform. To ease "
"this a little, a special built-in type is provided, :ref:`InputEvent "
"<class_InputEvent>`. This datatype can be configured to contain several "
"types of input events. Input events travel through the engine and can be "
"received in multiple locations, depending on the purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is a quick example, closing your game if the escape key is hit:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, it is cleaner and more flexible to use the provided :ref:`InputMap "
"<class_InputMap>` feature, which allows you to define input actions and "
"assign them different keys. This way, you can define multiple keys for the "
"same action (e.g. the keyboard escape key and the start button on a "
"gamepad). You can then more easily change this mapping in the project "
"settings without updating your code, and even build a key mapping feature on "
"top of it to allow your game to change the key mapping at runtime!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can set up your InputMap under **Project > Project Settings > Input "
"Map** and then use those actions like this:"

msgid "How does it work?"
msgstr "Come funziona?"

msgid ""
"Every input event is originated from the user/player (though it's possible "
"to generate an InputEvent and feed them back to the engine, which is useful "
"for gestures). The DisplayServer for each platform will read events from the "
"operating system, then feed them to the root :ref:`Window <class_Window>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The window's :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` does quite a lot of stuff with "
"the received input, in order:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Viewport is embedding Windows, the Viewport tries to interpret the "
"event in its capability as a Window-Manager (e.g. for resizing or moving "
"Windows)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next if an embedded Window is focused, the event is sent to that Window and "
"processed in the Windows Viewport and afterwards treated as handled. If no "
"embedded Window is focused, the event is sent to the nodes of the current "
"viewport in the following order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First of all, the standard :ref:`Node._input() "
"<class_Node_private_method__input>` function will be called in any node that "
"overrides it (and hasn't disabled input processing with :ref:`Node."
"set_process_input() <class_Node_method_set_process_input>`). If any function "
"consumes the event, it can call :ref:`Viewport.set_input_as_handled() "
"<class_Viewport_method_set_input_as_handled>`, and the event will not spread "
"any more. This ensures that you can filter all events of interest, even "
"before the GUI. For gameplay input, :ref:`Node._unhandled_input() "
"<class_Node_private_method__unhandled_input>` is generally a better fit, "
"because it allows the GUI to intercept the events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Second, it will try to feed the input to the GUI, and see if any control can "
"receive it. If so, the :ref:`Control <class_Control>` will be called via the "
"virtual function :ref:`Control._gui_input() "
"<class_Control_private_method__gui_input>` and the signal \"gui_input\" will "
"be emitted (this function is re-implementable by script by inheriting from "
"it). If the control wants to \"consume\" the event, it will call :ref:"
"`Control.accept_event() <class_Control_method_accept_event>` and the event "
"will not spread any more. Use the :ref:`Control.mouse_filter "
"<class_Control_property_mouse_filter>` property to control whether a :ref:"
"`Control <class_Control>` is notified of mouse events via :ref:`Control."
"_gui_input() <class_Control_private_method__gui_input>` callback, and "
"whether these events are propagated further."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If so far no one consumed the event, the :ref:`Node._shortcut_input() "
"<class_Node_private_method__shortcut_input>` callback will be called if "
"overridden (and not disabled with :ref:`Node.set_process_shortcut_input() "
"<class_Node_method_set_process_shortcut_input>`). This happens only for :ref:"
"`InputEventKey <class_InputEventKey>`, :ref:`InputEventShortcut "
"<class_InputEventShortcut>` and :ref:`InputEventJoypadButton "
"<class_InputEventJoypadButton>`. If any function consumes the event, it can "
"call :ref:`Viewport.set_input_as_handled() "
"<class_Viewport_method_set_input_as_handled>`, and the event will not spread "
"any more. The shortcut input callback is ideal for treating events that are "
"intended as shortcuts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If so far no one consumed the event, the :ref:`Node._unhandled_key_input() "
"<class_Node_private_method__unhandled_key_input>` callback will be called if "
"overridden (and not disabled with :ref:`Node."
"set_process_unhandled_key_input() "
"<class_Node_method_set_process_unhandled_key_input>`). This happens only if "
"the event is a :ref:`InputEventKey <class_InputEventKey>`. If any function "
"consumes the event, it can call :ref:`Viewport.set_input_as_handled() "
"<class_Viewport_method_set_input_as_handled>`, and the event will not spread "
"any more. The unhandled key input callback is ideal for key events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If so far no one consumed the event, the :ref:`Node._unhandled_input() "
"<class_Node_private_method__unhandled_input>` callback will be called if "
"overridden (and not disabled with :ref:`Node.set_process_unhandled_input() "
"<class_Node_method_set_process_unhandled_input>`). If any function consumes "
"the event, it can call :ref:`Viewport.set_input_as_handled() "
"<class_Viewport_method_set_input_as_handled>`, and the event will not spread "
"any more. The unhandled input callback is ideal for full-screen gameplay "
"events, so they are not received when a GUI is active."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no one wanted the event so far, and :ref:`Object Picking "
"<class_viewport_property_physics_object_picking>` is turned on, the event is "
"used for object picking. For the root viewport, this can also be enabled in :"
"ref:`Project Settings <class_ProjectSettings_property_physics/common/"
"enable_object_picking>`. In the case of a 3D scene if a :ref:`Camera3D "
"<class_Camera3D>` is assigned to the Viewport, a ray to the physics world "
"(in the ray direction from the click) will be cast. If this ray hits an "
"object, it will call the :ref:`CollisionObject3D._input_event() "
"<class_CollisionObject3D_private_method__input_event>` function in the "
"relevant physics object. In the case of a 2D scene, conceptually the same "
"happens with :ref:`CollisionObject2D._input_event() "
"<class_CollisionObject2D_private_method__input_event>`."

msgid ""
"When sending events to its child and descendant nodes, the viewport will do "
"so, as depicted in the following graphic, in a reverse depth-first order, "
"starting with the node at the bottom of the scene tree, and ending at the "
"root node. Excluded from this process are Windows and SubViewports."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This order doesn't apply to :ref:`Control._gui_input() "
"<class_Control_private_method__gui_input>`, which uses a different method "
"based on event location or focused Control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since Viewports don't send events to other :ref:`SubViewports "
"<class_SubViewport>`, one of the following methods has to be used:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a :ref:`SubViewportContainer <class_SubViewportContainer>`, which "
"automatically sends events to its child :ref:`SubViewports "
"<class_SubViewport>` after :ref:`Node._input() "
"<class_Node_private_method__input>` or :ref:`Control._gui_input() "
"<class_Control_private_method__gui_input>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Implement event propagation based on the individual requirements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GUI events also travel up the scene tree but, since these events target "
"specific Controls, only direct ancestors of the targeted Control node "
"receive the event."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In accordance with Godot's node-based design, this enables specialized child "
"nodes to handle and consume particular events, while their ancestors, and "
"ultimately the scene root, can provide more generalized behavior if needed."
