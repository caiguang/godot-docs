"Fog shaders are used to define how fog is added (or subtracted) from a scene "
"in a given area. Fog shaders are always used together with :ref:`FogVolumes "
"<class_FogVolume>` and volumetric fog. Fog shaders only have one processing "
"function, the ``fog()`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The resolution of the fog shaders depends on the resolution of the "
"volumetric fog froxel grid. Accordingly, the level of detail that a fog "
"shader can add depends on how close the :ref:`FogVolume <class_FogVolume>` "
"is to the camera."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Fog shaders are a special form of compute shader that is called once for "
"every froxel that is touched by an axis aligned bounding box of the "
"associated :ref:`FogVolume <class_FogVolume>`. This means that froxels that "
"just barely touch a given :ref:`FogVolume <class_FogVolume>` will still be "
"used."
