msgid "What is variable rate shading?"
msgstr "Cos'è la bisezione?"

msgid ""
"In modern 3D rendering engines, shaders are much more complex compared to "
"before. The advent of physically-based rendering, real-time global "
"illumination and screen-space effects has increased the number of *per-"
"pixel* shading that must be performed to render each frame. Additionally, "
"screen resolutions also have increased a lot, with 1440p and 4K now being "
"common target resolutions. As a result, the total shading cost in scene "
"rendering usually represents a significant amount of the time taken to "
"render each frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Variable rate shading (VRS) is a method of decreasing this shading cost by "
"reducing the resolution of *per-pixel* shading (also called *fragment* "
"shading), while keeping the original resolution for rendering geometry. This "
"means geometry edges remain as sharp as they would without VRS. VRS can be "
"combined with any :ref:`doc_3d_antialiasing` technique (MSAA, FXAA, TAA, "
"SSAA)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"VRS allows specifying the shading quality in a local manner, which makes it "
"possible to have certain parts of the viewport receive more detailed shading "
"than others. This is particularly useful in virtual reality (VR) to achieve "
"*foveated rendering*, where the center of the viewport is more detailed than "
"the edges."

"You can create your own VRS density map manually using an image editor, or "

"There are no size or aspect ratio requirements for the VRS density texture. "
"However, there is no benefit to using a VRS density map that is larger than "
"the viewport resolution divided by the GPU's *tile size*. The tile size is "
"what determines the smallest area of pixels where the shading density can be "
"changed separately from other tiles. On most GPUs, this tile size is 8×8 "
"pixels. You can view the tile size by running Godot with the ``--verbose`` "
"command line argument, as it's printed in the VRS debugging information."

"Therefore, sticking to a relatively low resolution such as 256×256 (square) "
"or 480×270 (16:9) is recommended. Depending on your use cases, a square "
"texture may be more suited compared to a texture that matches the most "
