"Sometimes a visual effect cannot be created with a single particle system "
"alone. Sometimes a particle system needs to be spawned as a response to "
"something that happens in another particle system. Fireworks are a good "
"example of that. They usually consist of several stages of explosions that "
"happen in sequence. Sub-emitters are a good way to achieve this kind of "
"effect."

"A sub-emitter is a particle system that spawns as a child of another "
"particle system. You can add sub-emitters to sub-emitters, chaining particle "
"effects as deep as you like."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a sub-emitter, you need at least two particle systems in the same "
"scene. One of them will be the parent and one will be set as the child. Find "
"the ``Sub Emitter`` property on the parent and click the box next to it to "
"assign the sub-emitter. You will see a list of available particle systems in "
"the scene. Select one and click the confirmation button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Particle systems from instanced scenes can be set as sub-emitters too, as "
"long as the ``Editable Children`` property is enabled on the instanced "
"scene. This also works the other way around: You can assign a sub-emitter to "
"a particle system in an instanced scene, even one coming from a different "
"instanced scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you set a particle system as the sub-emitter of another, the system "
"stops emitting, even if the ``Emitting`` property was checked. Don't worry, "
"it didn't break. This happens to every particle system as soon as it becomes "
"a sub-emitter. You also won't be able to re-enable the property as long as "
"the particle system is used as a sub-emitter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Even though the parent particle system can be selected from the list of "
"available particle systems, a particle system which is its own sub-emitter "
"does not work in Godot. It will simply not spawn. The same is true for any "
"other kind of recursive or self-referential sub-emitter setup."

msgid ""
"When you assign a sub-emitter, you don't see it spawn right away. Emitting "
"is disabled by default and needs to be enabled first. Set the ``Mode`` "
"property in the ``Sub Emitter`` group of the :ref:`ParticleProcessMaterial "
"<doc_process_material_properties_subemitter>` to something other than "
"``Disabled``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The emitter mode also determines how many sub-emitter particles are spawned. "
"``Constant`` spawns a single particle at a frequency set by the "
"``Frequency`` property. For ``At End`` and ``At Collision`` you can set the "
"amount directly with the ``Amount At End`` and the ``Amount At Collision`` "
"properties."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limitations"
msgstr "Limitazioni"

msgid ""
"One thing to keep in mind is that the total number of active particles from "
"the sub-emitter is always capped by the ``Amount`` property on the sub-"
"emitter particle system. If you find that there are not enough particles "
"spawned from the sub-emitter, you might have to increase the amount in the "
"particle system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some emitter properties are ignored when a particle system is spawned as a "
"sub-emitter. The ``Explosiveness`` property, for example, has no effect. "
"Depending on the emitter mode, the particles are either spawned sequentially "
"at fixed intervals or explosively all at once."
