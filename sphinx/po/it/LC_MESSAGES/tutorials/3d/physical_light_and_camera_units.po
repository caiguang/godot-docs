msgid "Why use physical light and camera units?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot uses arbitrary units for many physical properties that apply to light "
"like color, energy, camera field of view, and exposure. By default, these "
"properties use arbitrary units, because using accurate physical units comes "
"with a few tradeoffs that aren't worth it for many games. As Godot favors "
"ease of use by default, physical light units are disabled by default."

msgid "Advantages of physical units"
msgstr "Vantaggi"

msgid ""
"If you aim for photorealism in your project, using real world units as a "
"basis can help make things easier to adjust. References for real world "
"materials, lights and scene brightness are wildly available on websites such "
"as `Physically Based <https://physicallybased.info/>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using real world units in Godot can also be useful when porting a scene from "
"other 3D software that uses physical light units (such as Blender)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disadvantages of physical units"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The biggest disadvantage of using physical light units is you will have to "
"pay close attention to the dynamic range in use at a given time. You can run "
"into floating point precision errors when mixing very high light intensities "
"with very low light intensities."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In practice, this means that you will have to manually manage your exposure "
"settings to ensure that you aren't over-exposing or under-exposing your "
"scene too much. Auto-exposure can help you balance the light in a scene to "
"bring it into a normal range, but it can't recover lost precision from a "
"dynamic range that is too high."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using physical light and camera units will not automatically make your "
"project look *better*. Sometimes, moving away from realism can actually make "
"a scene look better to the human eye. Also, using physical units requires a "
"greater amount of rigor compared to non-physical units. Most benefits of "
"physical units can only be obtained if the units are correctly set to match "
"real world reference."

"Since physical light and camera units only require a handful of calculations "
"to handle unit conversion, enabling them doesn't have any noticeable "
"performance impact on the CPU. However, on the GPU side, physical camera "
"units currently enforce depth of field. This has a moderate performance "
"impact. To alleviate this performance impact, depth of field quality can be "
"decreased in the advanced Project Settings."

"When physical light units are enabled and if you have a WorldEnvironment "
"node in your scene (i.e. the editor Environment is disabled), you **must** "
"have a :ref:`class_CameraAttributes` resource assigned to the "
"WorldEnvironment node. Otherwise, the 3D editor viewport will appear "
"extremely bright if you have a visible DirectionalLight3D node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the Camera3D node, you can add a :ref:`class_CameraAttributes` resource "
"to its **Attributes** property. This resource is used to control the "
"camera's depth of field and exposure. When using :ref:"
"`class_CameraAttributesPhysical`, its focal length property is also used to "
"adjust the camera's field of view."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When physical light units are enabled, the following additional properties "
"become available in CameraAttributesPhysical's **Exposure** section:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Aperture:** The size of the aperture of the camera, measured in f-stops. "
"An f-stop is a unitless ratio between the focal length of the camera and the "
"diameter of the aperture. A high aperture setting will result in a smaller "
"aperture which leads to a dimmer image and sharper focus. A low aperture "
"results in a wide aperture which lets in more light resulting in a brighter, "
"less-focused image."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Shutter Speed:** The time for shutter to open and close, measured in "
"*inverse seconds* (``1/N``). A lower value will let in more light leading to "
"a brighter image, while a higher value will let in less light leading to a "
"darker image. *When getting or setting this property with a script, the unit "
"is in seconds instead of inverse seconds.*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Sensitivity:** The sensitivity of camera sensors, measured in ISO. A "
"higher sensitivity results in a brighter image. When auto exposure is "
"enabled, this can be used as a method of exposure compensation. Doubling the "
"value will increase the exposure value (measured in EV100) by 1 stop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Multiplier:** A *non-physical* exposure multiplier. Higher values will "
"increase the scene's brightness. This can be used for post-processing "
"adjustments or for animation purposes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default **Aperture** value of 16 f-stops is appropriate for outdoors at "
"daytime (i.e. for use with a default DirectionalLight3D). For indoor "
"lighting, a value between 2 and 4 is more appropriate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Typical shutter speed used in photography and movie production is 1/50 (0.02 "
"seconds). Night-time photography generally uses a shutter around 1/10 (0.1 "
"seconds), while sports photography uses a shutter speed between 1/250 (0.004 "
"seconds) and 1/1000 (0.001 seconds) to reduce motion blur."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In real life, sensitivity is usually set between 50 ISO and 400 ISO for "
"daytime outdoor photography depending on weather conditions. Higher values "
"are used for indoor or night-time photography."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike real life cameras, the adverse effects of increasing ISO sensitivity "
"or decreasing shutter speed (such as visible grain or light trails) are not "
"simulated in Godot."

"After adding a :ref:`class_CameraAttributesPhysical` resource to the "
"**Camera Attributes** property of a Camera3D nodes, some properties such as "
"**FOV** will no longer be editable. Instead, these properties are now "
"governed by the CameraAttributesPhysical's properties, such as focal length "
"and aperture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CameraAttributesPhysical offers the following properties in its **Frustum** "
"section:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Focus Distance:** Distance from camera of object that will be in focus, "
"measured in meters. Internally, this will be clamped to be at least 1 "
"millimeter larger than the **Focal Length**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Focal Length:** Distance between camera lens and camera aperture, measured "
"in millimeters. Controls field of view and depth of field. A larger focal "
"length will result in a smaller field of view and a narrower depth of field "
"meaning fewer objects will be in focus. A smaller focal length will result "
"in a wider field of view and a larger depth of field, which means more "
"objects will be in focus. This property overrides the Camera3D's **FOV** and "
"**Keep Aspect** properties, making them read-only in the inspector."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Near/Far:** The near and far clip distances in meters. These behave the "
"same as the Camera3D properties of the same name. Lower **Near** values "
"allow the camera to display objects that are very close, at the cost of "
"potential precision (Z-fighting) issues in the distance. Higher **Far** "
"values allow the camera to see further away, also at the cost of potential "
"precision (Z-fighting) issues in the distance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default focal length of 35 mm corresponds to a wide angle lens. It still "
"results in a field of view that is noticeably narrower compared to the "
"default \"practical\" vertical FOV of 75 degrees. This is because non-gaming "
"use cases such as filmmaking and photography favor using a narrower field of "
"view for a more cinematic appearance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Common focal length values used in filmmaking and photography are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Fisheye (ultrawide angle):** Below 15 mm. Nearly no depth of field visible."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Wide angle:** Between 15 mm and 50 mm. Reduced depth of field."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Standard:** Between 50 mm and 100 mm. Standard depth of field."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Telephoto:** Greater than 100 mm. Increased depth of field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like when using the **Keep Height** aspect mode, the effective field of view "
"depends on the viewport's aspect ratio, with wider aspect ratios "
"automatically resulting in a wider *horizontal* field of view."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Automatic exposure adjustment based on the camera's average brightness level "
"can also be enabled in the **Auto Exposure** section, with the following "
"properties:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Min Sensitivity:** The darkest brightness the camera is allowed to get to, "
"measured in EV100."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Max Sensitivity:** The brightest the camera is allowed to get to, measured "
"in EV100."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Speed:** The speed of the auto exposure effect. Affects the time needed "
"for the camera to perform auto exposure. Higher values allow for faster "
"transitions, but the resulting adjustments may look distracting depending on "
"the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Scale:** The scale of the auto exposure effect. Affects the intensity of "
"auto exposure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"EV100 is an exposure value (EV) measured at an ISO sensitivity of 100. See "
