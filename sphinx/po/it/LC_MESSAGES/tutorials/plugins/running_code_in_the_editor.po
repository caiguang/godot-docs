msgid "What is ``@tool``?"
msgstr "Che cos'è ``tool`?"

msgid ""
"``@tool`` is a powerful line of code that, when added at the top of your "
"script, makes it execute in the editor. You can also decide which parts of "
"the script execute in the editor, which in game, and which in both."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use it for doing many things, but it is mostly useful in level "
"design for visually presenting things that are hard to predict ourselves. "
"Here are some use cases:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have a cannon that shoots cannonballs affected by physics (gravity), "
"you can draw the cannonball's trajectory in the editor, making level design "
"a lot easier."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have jumppads with varying jump heights, you can draw the maximum "
"jump height a player would reach if it jumped on one, also making level "
"design easier."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your player doesn't use a sprite, but draws itself using code, you can "
"make that drawing code execute in the editor to see your player."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``@tool`` scripts run inside the editor, and let you access the scene tree "
"of the currently edited scene. This is a powerful feature which also comes "
"with caveats, as the editor does not include protections for potential "
"misuse of ``@tool`` scripts. Be **extremely** cautious when manipulating the "
"scene tree, especially via :ref:`Node."
"queue_free<class_Node_method_queue_free>`, as it can cause crashes if you "
"free a node while the editor runs logic involving it."

msgid "How to use ``@tool``"
msgstr "Che cos'è ``tool`?"

msgid ""
"To turn a script into a tool, add the ``@tool`` annotation at the top of "
"your code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check if you are currently in the editor, use: ``Engine."
"is_editor_hint()``."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, if you want to execute some code only in the editor, use:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the other hand, if you want to execute code only in game, simply negate "
"the same statement:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pieces of code that do not have either of the 2 conditions above will run "
"both in-editor and in-game."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is how a ``_process()`` function might look for you:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Modifications in the editor are permanent. For example, in the following "
"case, when we remove the script, the node will keep its rotation. Be careful "
"to avoid making unwanted modifications."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Extending a ``@tool`` script does not automatically make the extending "
"script a ``@tool``. Omitting ``@tool`` from the extending script will "
"disable tool behavior from the super class. Therefore the extending script "
"should also specify the ``@tool`` annotation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Try ``@tool`` out"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a ``Sprite2D`` node to your scene and set the texture to Godot icon. "
"Attach and open a script, and change it to this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save the script and return to the editor. You should now see your object "
"rotate. If you run the game, it will also rotate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't see the changes, reload the scene (close it and open it again)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now let's choose which code runs when. Modify your ``_process()`` function "
"to look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save the script. Now the object will spin clockwise in the editor, but if "
"you run the game, it will spin counter-clockwise."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Editing variables"
msgstr "Modificare le istanze"

msgid ""
"Add and export a variable speed to the script. To update the speed and also "
"reset the rotation angle add a setter ``set(new_speed)`` which is executed "
"with the input from the inspector. Modify ``_process()`` to include the "
"rotation speed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Code from other nodes doesn't run in the editor. Your access to other nodes "
"is limited. You can access the tree and nodes, and their default properties, "
"but you can't access user variables. If you want to do so, other nodes have "
"to run in the editor too. Autoload nodes cannot be accessed in the editor at "
"all."

msgid "Reporting node configuration warnings"
msgstr "Conﬁgurazione"

msgid ""
"Godot uses a *node configuration warning* system to warn users about "
"incorrectly configured nodes. When a node isn't configured correctly, a "
"yellow warning sign appears next to the node's name in the Scene dock. When "
"you hover or click on the icon, a warning message pops up. You can use this "
"feature in your scripts to help you and your team avoid mistakes when "
"setting up scenes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using node configuration warnings, when any value that should affect or "
"remove the warning changes, you need to call :ref:"
"`update_configuration_warnings<class_Node_method_update_configuration_warnings>` . "
"By default, the warning only updates when closing and reopening the scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running one-off scripts using EditorScript"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes, you need to run code just one time to automate a certain task "
"that is not available in the editor out of the box. Some examples might be:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use as a playground for GDScript or C# scripting without having to run a "
"project. ``print()`` output is displayed in the editor Output panel."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scale all light nodes in the currently edited scene, as you noticed your "
"level ends up looking too dark or too bright after placing lights where "
"desired."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Replace nodes that were copy-pasted with scene instances to make them easier "
"to modify later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is available in Godot by extending :ref:`class_EditorScript` in a "
"script. This provides a way to run individual scripts in the editor without "
"having to create an editor plugin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create an EditorScript, right-click a folder or empty space in the "
"FileSystem dock then choose **New > Script...**. In the script creation "
"dialog, click the tree icon to choose an object to extend from (or enter "
"``EditorScript`` directly in the field on the left, though note this is case-"
"sensitive):"

msgid "Creating an editor script in the script editor creation dialog"
msgstr "Istanziamento con segnali"

msgid ""
"This will automatically select a script template that is suited for "
"EditorScripts, with a ``_run()`` method already inserted:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This ``_run()`` method is executed when you use **File > Run** or the "
"keyboard shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + X` while the EditorScript is the "
"currently open script in the script editor. This keyboard shortcut is only "
"effective when currently focused on the script editor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scripts that extend EditorScript must be ``@tool`` scripts to function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"EditorScripts have no undo/redo functionality, so **make sure to save your "
"scene before running one** if the script is designed to modify any data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To access nodes in the currently edited scene, use the :ref:`EditorScript."
"get_scene <class_EditorScript_method_get_scene>` method which returns the "
"root Node of the currently edited scene. Here's an example that recursively "
"gets all nodes in the currently edited scene and doubles the range of all "
"OmniLight3D nodes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can change the currently edited scene at the top of the editor even "
"while the Script view is open. This will affect the return value of :ref:"
"`EditorScript.get_scene <class_EditorScript_method_get_scene>`, so make sure "
"you've selected the scene you intend to iterate upon before running the "
"script."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instancing scenes"
msgstr "Istanziare scene"

msgid ""
"You can instantiate packed scenes normally and add them to the scene "
"currently opened in the editor. By default, nodes or scenes added with :ref:"
"`Node.add_child(node) <class_Node_method_add_child>` are **not** visible in "
"the Scene tree dock and are **not** persisted to disk. If you wish the node "
"or scene to be visible in the scene tree dock and persisted to disk when "
"saving the scene, you need to set the child node's :ref:`owner "
"<class_Node_property_owner>` property to the currently edited scene root."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you are using ``@tool``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you are using :ref:`EditorScript<class_EditorScript>`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using ``@tool`` improperly can yield many errors. It is advised to first "
"write the code how you want it, and only then add the ``@tool`` annotation "
"to the top. Also, make sure to separate code that runs in-editor from code "
"that runs in-game. This way, you can find bugs more easily."
