"The GDScript warning system complements :ref:`static typing "
"<doc_gdscript_static_typing>` (but it can work without static typing too). "
"It's here to help you avoid mistakes that are hard to spot during "
"development, and that may lead to runtime errors."
msgstr ""
"GDScript 警告系统是对\\ :ref:`静态类型 <doc_gdscript_static_typing>`\\ 的补充"
"（也可以在没有静态类型的情况下工作），可以在开发过程中帮助避免因难以发现的错"
"误而导致运行时错误。"

"You can configure warnings in the Project Settings under the section called "
"**GDScript**:"

"To ignore specific warnings in one file, insert an annotation of the form "

"Warnings won't prevent the game from running, but you can turn them into "
"errors if you'd like. This way your game won't compile unless you fix all "
"warnings. Head to the ``GDScript`` section of the Project Settings to turn "
"on this option to the warning that you want. Here's the same file as the "
"previous example with the warning ``unused_variable`` as an error turned on:"
