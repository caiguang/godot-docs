msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"**GDExtension** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine interact "
"with native `shared libraries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries>`__ at run-time. You can use it to run "
"native code without compiling it with the engine."
msgstr ""
"**GDExtension** 是 Godot 专有的技术，可以让引擎在运行时与原生\\ `共享库 "
"<https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/"
"%E5%87%BD%E5%BC%8F%E5%BA%AB#%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB%E5%BA%93>`__\\ 交互。你可以通"
"过它来执行原生代码，无需和引擎一同编译。"

msgid ""
"GDExtension is *not* a scripting language and has no relation to :ref:"
"`GDScript <doc_gdscript>`."
msgstr ""
"GDExtension *不是*\\ 脚本语言，与 :ref:`GDScript <doc_gdscript>` 无关。"

msgid "Differences between GDExtension and C++ modules"
msgstr "GDExtension 与 C++ 模块的区别"

msgid ""
"You can use both GDExtension and :ref:`C++ modules "
"<doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` to run C or C++ code in a Godot project."
msgstr ""
"GDExtension 和 :ref:`C++ 模块 <doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>`\\ 都可以用于在 "
"Godot 项目中执行 C 或 C++ 代码。"

msgid ""
"They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The "
"one you should choose depends on your needs."
msgstr "它们都可以用来将第三方库集成进 Godot。选用哪一个取决于你的需求。"

msgid ""
"Our long-term goal is that GDExtensions targeting an earlier version of "
"Godot will work in later minor versions, but not vice-versa. For example, a "
"GDExtension targeting Godot 4.2 should work just fine in Godot 4.3, but one "
"targeting Godot 4.3 won't work in Godot 4.2."
msgstr ""
"我们的长期目标是，面向早先版本的 GDExtension 在后续的小版本中依然能够运作，但"
"反之则不然。例如，一个面向 Godot 4.2 的 GDExtension 应当在 Godot 4.3 中正常运"
"作，但面向 Godot 4.3 的则不能在 Godot 4.2 中运作。"

msgid ""
"However, GDExtension is currently *experimental*, which means that we may "
"break compatibility in order to fix major bugs or include critical features. "
"For example, GDExtensions created for Godot 4.0 aren't compatible with Godot "
"4.1 (see :ref:`updating_your_gdextension_for_godot_4_1`)."
msgstr ""
"不过，GDExtension 目前仍是 *实验性的*，这就意味着我们为了修复严重的 bug 或引"
"入重大的特性，可能会牺牲兼容性。例如，为 Godot 4.0 创建的 GDExtension 与 "
"Godot 4.1 并不兼容（参见 :ref:`updating_your_gdextension_for_godot_4_1` ）。"

msgid "Advantages of GDExtension"
msgstr "GDExtension 的优点"

msgid ""
"Unlike modules, GDExtension doesn't require compiling the engine's source "
"code, making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most "
"of the API available to GDScript and C#, allowing you to code game logic "
"with full control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-"
"performance code you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset "
"library <doc_what_is_assetlib>`."
msgstr ""
"与模块不同，GDNative 不需要编译引擎的源码，可以使你的作品更易于分发。它可以让"
"你访问 GDScript、C# 使用的大多数 API，让你在编写游戏逻辑时能够完全控制性能。"
"这是你在\\ :ref:`资产库 <doc_what_is_assetlib>`\\ 中以插件形式分发高性能代码"
"的理想选择。"

msgid "Also:"
msgstr "并且："

msgid ""
"GDExtension is not limited to C and C++. Thanks to :ref:`third-party "
"bindings <doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, you can use it with "
"many other languages."
msgstr ""
"GDExtension 并不仅限于 C 和 C++。得益于\\ :ref:`第三方绑定 "
"<doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`\\ ，你也可以在很多其他语言中使"

msgid ""
"You can use the same compiled GDExtension library in the editor and exported "
"project. With C++ modules, you have to recompile all the export templates "
"you plan to use if you require its functionality at run-time."
msgstr ""
"你可以在编辑器和导出项目中使用相同的编译后的 GDNative 库。而对于 C++ 模块，如"
"果你想在运行时使用相关功能，就必须重新编译所有想要使用的导出模板。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"GDExtension only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. "
"That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. "
"Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with "
"incremental builds, this process is slower than using GDExtension."
msgstr ""
"GDNative 只需编译你自己的库，而不是整个引擎。C++ 模块则与此不同，是会静态编译"
"进引擎的。每修改一次模块，你就需要重新编译一次引擎。即使使用增量构建，这一过"
"程也比 GDNative 要慢。"

msgid "Advantages of C++ modules"
msgstr "C++ 模块的优点"

msgid ""
"We recommend :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` in cases where "
"GDExtension isn't enough:"
msgstr ""
"如果 GDExtension 无法满足要求，我们推荐使用 :ref:`C++ 模块 "
"<doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>`\\ ："

msgid ""
"C++ modules provide deeper integration into the engine. GDExtension's access "
"is not as deep as static modules."
msgstr ""
"C++ 模块提供了与引擎更深层次的集成。GDExtension 的访问能力不如静态模块那般深"
"入。"

msgid ""
"You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without "
"carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."
msgstr ""
"使用 C++ 模块为项目提供额外功能，就可以免去携带原生库文件的麻烦。同样也适用于"
"导出的项目。"

msgid ""
"If you notice that specific systems are not accessible via GDExtension but "
"are via custom modules, feel free to open an issue on the `godot-cpp "
"repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp>`__ to discuss "
"implementation options for exposing the missing functionality."
