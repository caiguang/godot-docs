msgid ""
"Godot doesn't allow exporting explicit interface property implementations. "
"When an interface member is implemented explicitly, the member is hidden and "
"consumers can't access them unless the type is converted to the interface "
"first. Explicitly implemented members can also share the same name of other "
"members in the type, so it could create naming conflicts with other exported "
"members."
