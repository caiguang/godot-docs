msgid "Making HTTP requests"

msgid "Why use HTTP?"
msgstr "为什么使用 HTTP？"

msgid ""
"`HTTP requests <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP>`_ are "
"useful to communicate with web servers and other non-Godot programs."
msgstr ""
"`HTTP 请求 <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP>`_\\ 可以用来"
"与 Web 服务器以及其他非 Godot 程序通信。"

msgid ""
"Compared to Godot's other networking features (like :ref:`High-level "
"multiplayer <doc_high_level_multiplayer>`), HTTP requests have more overhead "
"and take more time to get going, so they aren't suited for real-time "
"communication, and aren't great to send lots of small updates as is common "
"for multiplayer gameplay."
msgstr ""
"与 Godot 的其他网络功能（例如\\ :ref:`高阶多人游戏 "
"<doc_high_level_multiplayer>`\\ ）相比，HTTP 请求的额外开销更大，起步也更慢，"
"所以并不适合实时通信，也不善于进行多人游戏中常见的大量较小更新的发送。"

"HTTP, however, offers interoperability with external web resources and is "
"great at sending and receiving large amounts of data, for example to "
"transfer files like game assets. These assets can then be loaded using :ref:"
"`runtime file loading and saving <doc_runtime_loading_and_saving>`."
msgstr ""
"然而 HTTP 能够与外部 Web 资源进行交互，善于进行较大数据的发送和接收，例如传送"
"游戏资产等文件。"

msgid ""
"So HTTP may be useful for your game's login system, lobby browser, to "
"retrieve some information from the web or to download game assets."
msgstr ""
"所以 HTTP 可以用在游戏的登录系统、大厅浏览器，可以从 Web 获取信息，也可以下载"
"游戏资产。"

msgid ""
"This tutorial assumes some familiarity with Godot and the Godot Editor. "
"Refer to the :ref:`Introduction <toc-learn-introduction>` and the :ref:`Step "
"by step <toc-learn-step_by_step>` tutorial, especially its :ref:`Nodes and "
"Scenes <doc_nodes_and_scenes>` and :ref:`Creating your first script "
"<doc_scripting_first_script>` pages if needed."

msgid "HTTP requests in Godot"
msgstr "Godot 中的 HTTP 请求"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` node is the easiest way to make "
"HTTP requests in Godot. It is backed by the more low-level :ref:`HTTPClient "
"<class_HTTPClient>`, for which a tutorial is available :ref:`here "
"<doc_http_client_class>`."
msgstr ""
"在Godot中, 用 :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` 节点发出HTTP请求是最简单"
"的方法. 它继承自更低级别的 :ref:`HTTPClient <class_HTTPClient>` , 相关的教程"
"见 :ref:`here <doc_http_client_class>`."

msgid ""
"For this example, we will make an HTTP request to GitHub to retrieve the "
"name of the latest Godot release."

"When exporting to **Android**, make sure to enable the **Internet** "
"permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or "
"using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be "
"blocked by the Android OS."
msgstr ""
"当导出到 Android 时，在导出项目或使用一键部署之前，确保在 Android 导出预设中"
"启用 ``INTERNET`` 权限。否则，任何形式的网络通信都会被 Android 系统阻止。"

msgid "Preparing the scene"
msgstr "准备场景"

msgid ""
"Create a new empty scene, add a root :ref:`Node <class_Node>` and add a "
"script to it. Then add a :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` node as a "
"child."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scripting the request"
msgstr "编写请求脚本"

msgid ""
"When the project is started (so in ``_ready()``), we're going to send an "
"HTTP request to Github using our :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` "
"node, and once the request completes, we're going to parse the returned JSON "
"data, look for the ``name`` field and print that to console."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save the script and the scene, and run the project. The name of the most "
"recent Godot release on Github should be printed to the output log. For more "
"information on parsing JSON, see the class references for :ref:`JSON "
"<class_JSON>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that you may want to check whether the ``result`` equals "
"``RESULT_SUCCESS`` and whether a JSON parsing error occurred, see the JSON "
"class reference and :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` for more."
msgstr ""
"请注意, 你可能需要检查 ``result`` 是否等于 ``RESULT_SUCCESS`` 以及JSON解析错"
"误是否发生, 要了解更多信息, 请参阅JSON类型参考和 :ref:`HTTPRequest "
"<class_HTTPRequest>` ."

msgid ""
"You have to wait for a request to finish before sending another one. Making "
"multiple request at once requires you to have one node per request. A common "
"strategy is to create and delete HTTPRequest nodes at runtime as necessary."
msgstr ""
"请记住, 在发送另一个请求之前, 您必须等待请求完成. 一次发出多个请求需要每个请"
"求有一个节点. 常见的策略是在运行时根据需要创建和删除HTTPRequest节点."

msgid "Sending data to the server"

"Of course, you can also set custom HTTP headers. These are given as a string "
"array, with each string containing a header in the format ``\"header: "
"value\"``. For example, to set a custom user agent (the HTTP ``User-Agent`` "
"header) you could use the following:"
msgstr ""
"当然, 您也可以设置自定义的HTTP头部. 它们以字符串数组的形式给出, 每个字符串都"
"包含一个格式为 ``\"header: value\"`` 的头部. 例如, 要设置自定义用户代理(HTTP"

"Be aware that someone might analyse and decompile your released application "
"and thus may gain access to any embedded authorization information like "
"tokens, usernames or passwords. That means it is usually not a good idea to "
"embed things such as database access credentials inside your game. Avoid "
"providing information useful to an attacker whenever possible."
msgstr ""
"此外, 在使用授权调用API时, 请注意有人可能会分析和反编译已发布的应用程序, 因此"
