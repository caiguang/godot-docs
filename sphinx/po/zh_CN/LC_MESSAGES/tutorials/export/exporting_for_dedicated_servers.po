"If you want to run a dedicated server for your project on a machine that "
"doesn't have a GPU or display server available, you'll need to run Godot "
"with the ``headless`` display server and ``Dummy`` :ref:`audio driver "
"<class_ProjectSettings_property_audio/driver/driver>`."
msgstr ""
"如果要在没有 GPU 或显示服务器的计算机上为项目运行专用服务器, 则需要使用 "
"Godot 的服务器版本."

"Since Godot 4.0, this can be done by running a Godot binary on any platform "
"with the ``--headless`` command line argument, or running a project exported "
"as dedicated server. You do not need to use a specialized server binary "
"anymore, unlike Godot 3.x."

"It is possible to use either an editor or export template (debug or release) "

"**Export template:** Use this one for running dedicated servers. It does not "

"**Editor:** This binary contains editor functionality and is intended to be "

msgid "Export approaches"
msgstr "导出方法"

msgid "There are two ways to export a project for a server:"
msgstr "有两种方法可以导出服务项目:"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Create a separate export preset for the platform that will host the server, "
"then export your project as usual."
msgstr ""
"创建Linux/X11导出预设, 并为Release(custom_template/release)选定指向服务器的可"
"执行文件, 然后照往常一样导出项目即可."

msgid ""
"Export a PCK file only, preferably for the platform that matches the "
"platform that will host the server. Place this PCK file in the same folder "
"as an export template binary, rename the binary to have the same name as the "
"PCK (minus the file extension), then run the binary."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Both methods should result in identical output. The rest of the page will "
"focus on the first approach."
msgstr "这两种方法的输出结果应该是相同的. 下文介绍了PCK文件的方法."

msgid "See :ref:`doc_exporting_projects` for more information."
msgstr "详见 :ref:`doc_exporting_projects` ."

msgid "Exporting a project for a dedicated server"
msgstr "为专用服务器导出项目"

msgid ""
"If you export a project as usual when targeting a server, you will notice "
"that the PCK file is just as large as for the client. This is because it "
"includes all resources, including those the server doesn't need (such as "
"texture data). Additionally, headless mode won't be automatically used; the "
"user will have to specify ``--headless`` to make sure no window spawns."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many resources such as textures can be stripped from the PCK file to greatly "
"reduce its size. Godot offers a way to do this for textures and materials in "
"a way that preserves references in scene or resource files (built-in or "
"external)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To begin doing so, make sure you have a dedicated export preset for your "
"server, then select it, go to its **Resources** tab and change its export "
"mode:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Choosing the **Export as dedicated server** export mode in the export preset"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When this export mode is chosen, the ``dedicated_server`` feature tag is "
"automatically added to the exported project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you do not wish to use this export mode but still want the feature tag, "
"you can write the name ``dedicated_server`` in the **Features** tab of the "
"export preset. This will also force ``--headless`` when running the exported "
"project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After selecting this export mode, you will be presented with a list of "
"resources in the project:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Choosing resources to keep, keep with stripped visuals or remove"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ticking a box allows you to override options for the specified file or "
"folder. Checking boxes does **not** affect which files are exported; this is "
"done by the options selected for each checkbox instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Files within a checked folder will automatically use the parent's option by "
"default, which is indicated by the **(Inherited)** suffix for the option "
"name (and the option name being grayed out). To change the option for a file "
"whose option is currently inherited, you must tick the box next to it first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Strip Visuals:** Export this resource, with visual files (textures and "
"materials) replaced by placeholder classes. Placeholder classes store the "
"image size (as it's sometimes used to position elements in a 2D scene), but "
"nothing else."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Keep:** Export this resource as usual, with visual files interact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Remove:** The file is not included in the PCK. This is useful to ignore "
"scenes and resources that only the client needs. If you do so, make sure the "
"server doesn't reference these client-only scenes and resources in any way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The general recommendation is to use **Strip Visuals** whenever possible, "
"unless the server needs to access image data such as pixels' colors. For "
"example, if your server generates collision data based on an image's "
"contents, you need to use **Keep** for that particular image."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check the file structure of your exported PCK, use the **Export PCK/ZIP..."
"** button with a ``.zip`` file extension, then open the resulting ZIP file "
"in a file manager."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Be careful when using the **Remove** mode, as scenes/resources that "
"reference a removed file will no longer be able to load successfully."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you wish to remove specific resources but make the scenes still be able "
"to load without them, you'll have to remove the reference in the scene file "
"and load the files to the nodes' properties using ``load()`` in a script. "
"This approach can be used to strip resources that Godot doesn't support "
"replacing with placeholders yet, such as audio."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Removing textures is often what makes the greatest impact on the PCK size, "
"so it is recommended to stick with **Strip Visuals** at first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the above options used, a PCK for the client (which exports all "
"resources normally) will look as follows:"
msgstr "使用上面的选项后，客户端的 PCK（正常导出所有资源）是这样的："

msgid "The PCK's file structure for the server will look as follows:"
msgstr "服务器的 PCK 文件结构是这样的："

msgid ""
"If both your client and server are part of the same Godot project, you will "
"have to add a way to start the server directly using a command-line argument."
msgstr ""
"如果你的客户端和服务都是同一个 Godot 项目的一部分，你必须添加一个使用命令行参"
"数直接启动服务的方法。这可以通过在你的主场景（或单例）的 ``_ready()`` 方法中"
"添加以下代码片段来实现。"

msgid ""
"If you :ref:`exported the project "
"<doc_exporting_for_dedicated_servers_exporting_project>` using the **Export "
"as dedicated server** export mode (or have added ``dedicated_server`` as a "
"custom feature tag), you can use the ``dedicated_server`` feature tag to "
"detect whether a dedicated server PCK is being used:"

"If you also wish to host a server when using the built-in ``--headless`` "
"command line argument, this can be done by adding the following code snippet "
"in your main scene (or an autoload)'s ``_ready()`` method:"

msgid ""
"It's a good idea to add at least one of the above command-line arguments to "
"start a server, as it can be used to test server functionality from the "
"command line without having to export the project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your client and server are separate Godot projects, your server should "
"most likely be configured in a way where running the main scene starts a "
"server automatically."

"如果你的客户端和服务器是独立的Godot项目, 服务器通常应该配置成运行主场景时自启"

msgstr "下一步"

"On Linux, to make your dedicated server restart after a crash or system "
"reboot, you can `create a systemd service <https://medium.com/@benmorel/"
"creating-a-linux-service-with-systemd-611b5c8b91d6>`__. This also lets you "
"view server logs in a more convenient fashion, with automatic log rotation "

msgid ""
"If you have experience with containers, you could also look into wrapping "
"your dedicated server in a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ container. "
"This way, it can be used more easily in an automatic scaling setup (which is "
"outside the scope of this tutorial)."
msgstr ""
"如果你有容器的经验, 可以考虑将专用服务器包装在一个 `Docker <https://www."
"docker.com/>`__ 容器中. 这样, 在弹性配置中可以更容易地使用它(这不在本教程的范"
