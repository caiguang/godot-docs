msgid "Exporting for Windows"

"This page describes how to export a Godot project to Windows. If you're "
"looking to compile editor or export template binaries from source instead, "
"read :ref:`doc_compiling_for_windows`."
msgstr ""
"这个页面描述的是如何将 Godot 项目导出到 Windows。如果你想要找的是从源码编译编"
"辑器或导出模板二进制文件，请阅读 :ref:`doc_compiling_for_windows`\\ 。"

"The simplest way to distribute a game for PC is to copy the executable "
"(``godot.exe``), compress the folder and send it to someone else. However, "
"this is often not desired."
msgstr ""
"在 PC 上分发游戏的最简单方法是复制可执行文件（\\ ``godot.exe``\\ ），将文件夹"
"压缩，然后发送给别人。然而，这样一般并不理想。"

msgid ""
"Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the "
"export system. When exporting for Windows, the exporter takes all the "
"project files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is bundled with a "
"specially optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does not contain the "
"editor and debugger."
msgstr ""
"Godot 在使用导出系统时，为 PC 分发提供了一种更为优雅的方法。为 Windows 导出"
"时，导出器将提取所有项目文件并创建一个 ``data.pck`` 文件。该文件与特别优化的"
"二进制文件捆绑在一起，更小、更快，并且不包含编辑器和调试器。"

msgid "Code signing"
msgstr "启用代码签名"

msgid ""
"Godot is capable of automatic code signing on export. To do this you must "
"have the ``Windows SDK`` (on Windows) or `osslsigncode <https://github.com/"
"mtrojnar/osslsigncode>`__ (on any other OS) installed. You will also need a "
"package signing certificate, information on creating one can be found `here "
"<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/appxpkg/how-to-create-a-"
"package-signing-certificate?redirectedfrom=MSDN>`__."

msgid ""
"If you export for Windows with embedded PCK files, you will not be able to "
"sign the program as it will break."
msgstr "如果你用内嵌的PCK文件导出到Windows, 你将无法签名程序, 因为它会崩溃."

msgid ""
"On Windows, PCK embedding is also known to cause false positives in "
"antivirus programs. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using it unless "
"you're distributing your project via Steam as it bypasses code signing and "
"antivirus checks."
msgstr ""
"在Windows上,PCK嵌入也会在杀毒软件中造成误报. 因此, 建议避免使用它, 除非你的项"
"目通过Steam发布, 因为这样就绕过了代码签名和防病毒检查."

msgid "Setup"
msgstr "场景布置"

msgid ""
"Settings need to be changed in two places. First, in the editor settings, "
"under **Export > Windows**. Click on the folder next to the ``Sign Tool`` "
"setting, if you're using Windows navigate to and select ``SignTool.exe``, if "
"you're on a different OS select ``osslsigncode``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second location is the Windows export preset, which can be found in "
"**Project > Export...**. Add a windows desktop preset if you haven't "
"already. Under options there is a code signing category."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``Enabled`` must be set to true, and ``Identity`` must be set to the signing "
"certificate. The other settings can be adjusted as needed. Once this is Done "
"Godot will sign your project on export."
msgstr ""

msgid "Environment variables"
msgstr "环境变量"

msgid ""
"You can use the following environment variables to set export options "
"outside of the editor. During the export process, these override the values "
"that you set in the export menu."

"你可以使用以下环境变量在编辑器外部设置导出选项。在导出过程中，这些值会覆盖你"
"在导出菜单中设置的值。"
