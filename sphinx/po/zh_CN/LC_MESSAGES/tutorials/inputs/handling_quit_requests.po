"Most platforms have the option to request the application to quit. On "
"desktops, this is usually done with the \"x\" icon on the window title bar. "
"On Android, the back button is used to quit when on the main screen (and to "
"go back otherwise)."

"大多数平台都有要求应用程序退出的选项。在桌面系统中，这通常是通过窗口标题栏上"
"的“x”图标来实现的。在 Android 系统上，当在主屏幕上时，后退按钮被用来退出（否"

"在桌面平台上, :ref:`MainLoop <class_MainLoop>` 有一个特殊的 ``MainLoop."
"NOTIFICATION_WM_QUIT_REQUEST`` 通知, 当请求退出时, 会向所有节点发送."

"On Android, ``NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` is sent instead. Pressing "
"the Back button will exit the application if **Application > Config > Quit "
"On Go Back** is checked in the Project Settings (which is the default)."

"在Android系统中, 会发送 ``MainLoop.NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` 代替. 如"
"果在项目设置中勾选了 **Application > Config > Quit On Go Back** (默认), 按"
"Back按钮将退出应用程序."

"``NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` isn't supported on iOS, as iOS devices "
"don't have a physical Back button."

"``MainLoop.NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` 在iOS上不支持, 因为iOS设备没有实"

"When developing mobile apps, quitting is not desired unless the user is on "

"It is important to note that by default, Godot apps have the built-in "
"behavior to quit when quit is requested from the window manager. This can be "
"changed, so that the user can take care of the complete quitting procedure:"

"值得注意的是, 默认情况下, 在请求退出时,Godot应用程序具有退出的内置行为, 可以"

"While forcing the application to close can be done by calling :ref:"
"`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>`, doing so will not send the "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` to the nodes in the scene tree. Quitting "
"by calling :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` will not "
"allow custom actions to complete (such as saving, confirming the quit, or "
"debugging), even if you try to delay the line that forces the quit."
msgstr ""
"虽然强迫应用程序关闭可以通过调用 :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 来完成，但这样做不会发送退出的\\ *通知*\\ 。这"
"意味着上面描述的函数不会被调用。通过调用 :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 来退出，将不允许自定义动作的完成（比如保存、确"
"认退出或调试），即使你试图延迟强制退出的行。"

"Instead, if you want to notify the nodes in the scene tree about the "
"upcoming program termination, you should send the notification yourself:"

msgid ""
"Sending this notification will inform all nodes about the program "
"termination, but will not terminate the program itself *unlike in 3.X*. In "
"order to achieve the previous behavior, :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` should be called after the notification."
