"Godot has nodes to draw sprites, polygons, particles, text, and many other "
"common game development needs. However, if you need something specific not "

"`Control <class_Control>` or :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>`-based) draw on "
"screen using custom commands."
msgstr ""
"Godot 有用于绘制精灵、多边形、粒子以及各种东西的节点。在大多数情况下，这就已"
