"Commonly, games need to load resources asynchronously. When switching the "
"main scene of your game (e.g. going to a new level), you might want to show "
"a loading screen with some indication that progress is being made, or you "
"may want to load additional resources during gameplay."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The standard load method (:ref:`ResourceLoader.load "
"<class_ResourceLoader_method_load>` or GDScript's simpler :ref:`load "
"<class_@GDScript_method_load>`) blocks your thread, making your game appear "
"unresponsive while the resource is being loaded."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One way around this is using ``ResourceLoader`` to load resources "
"asynchronously in background threads."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using ResourceLoader"
msgstr "使用 ResourceLoader"

msgid ""
"Generally, you queue requests to load resources for a path using :ref:"
"`ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request "
"<class_ResourceLoader_method_load_threaded_request>`, which will then be "
"loaded in threads in the background."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can check the status with :ref:`ResourceLoader.load_threaded_get_status "
"<class_ResourceLoader_method_load_threaded_get_status>`. Progress can be "
"obtained by passing an array variable via progress which will return a one "
"element array containing the percentage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, you retrieve loaded resources by calling :ref:`ResourceLoader."
"load_threaded_get <class_ResourceLoader_method_load_threaded_get>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you call ``load_threaded_get()``, either the resource finished loading "
"in the background and will be returned instantly or the load will block at "
"this point like ``load()`` would. If you want to guarantee this does not "
"block, you either need to ensure there is enough time between requesting the "
"load and retrieving the resource or you need to check the status manually."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example"
msgstr "示例"

msgid ""
"This example demonstrates how to load a scene in the background. We will "
"have a button spawn a enemy when pressed. The enemy will be ``Enemy.tscn`` "
"which we will load on ``_ready`` and instantiate when pressed. The path will "
"be ``\"Enemy.tscn\"`` which is located at ``res://Enemy.tscn``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, we will start a request to load the resource and connect the button:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now ``_on_button_pressed`` will be called when the button is pressed. This "
"method will be used to spawn an enemy."
