"Godot provides many post-processing effects out of the box, including Bloom, "
"DOF, and SSAO, which are described in :ref:"
"`doc_environment_and_post_processing`. However, advanced use cases may "
"require custom effects. This article explains how to write your own custom "
"effects."
msgstr ""
"Godot 提供许多开箱即用的后处理效果，包括泛光、DOF 和 SSAO。有时你想编写自己的"
"自定义效果。下面介绍如何做到这一点。"

"The easiest way to implement a custom post-processing shader is to use "
"Godot's built-in ability to read from the screen texture. If you're not "
"familiar with this, you should read the :ref:`Screen Reading Shaders "
"Tutorial <doc_screen-reading_shaders>` first."
msgstr ""
"实现自定义后期处理着色器的最简单方法是使用Godot的内置功能从屏幕纹理中读取. 如"
"果你不熟悉这个, 你应该先阅读 :ref:`屏幕阅读着色器教程 <doc_screen-"
"reading_shaders>` ."

msgid "Single pass post-processing"

"Post-processing effects are shaders applied to a frame after Godot has "
"rendered it. To apply a shader to a frame, create a :ref:`CanvasLayer "
"<class_CanvasLayer>`, and give it a :ref:`ColorRect <class_ColorRect>`. "
"Assign a new :ref:`ShaderMaterial <class_ShaderMaterial>` to the newly "
"created ``ColorRect``, and set the ``ColorRect``'s layout to \"Full Rect\"."

msgstr "您的场景层次结构将如下所示："

"Another more efficient method is to use a :ref:`BackBufferCopy "
"<class_BackBufferCopy>` to copy a region of the screen to a buffer and to "
"access it in a shader script through a ``sampler2D`` using "
"``hint_screen_texture``."

msgid ""
"As of the time of writing, Godot does not support rendering to multiple "
"buffers at the same time. Your post-processing shader will not have access "
"to other render passes and buffers not exposed by Godot (such as depth or "
"normal/roughness). You only have access to the rendered frame and buffers "
"exposed by Godot as samplers."
msgstr ""
"在撰写本文时,Godot不支持同时对多个缓冲区进行渲染. 处理之后着色器将无法访问法"
"线或其他渲染通道. 你只能访问已渲染的帧."

msgid ""
"For this demo, we will use this :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite2D>` of a sheep."
msgstr "这个演示中，我们使用的是这张小羊的\\ :ref:`精灵 <class_Sprite2D>`\\ 。"

msgid ""
"Assign a new :ref:`Shader <class_Shader>` to the ``ColorRect``'s "
"``ShaderMaterial``. You can access the frame's texture and UV with a "
"``sampler2D`` using ``hint_screen_texture`` and the built in ``SCREEN_UV`` "
"uniforms."
msgstr ""
"为 ``ColorRect`` 的 ``ShaderMaterial`` 分配一个新的 :ref:`Shader "
"<class_Shader>`\\ 。你可以通过使用带 ``hint_screen_texture`` 的 "
"``sampler2D`` 以及内置的 uniform ``SCREEN_UV`` 来访问这一帧的纹理和 UV。"

"Some post-processing effects like blurs are resource intensive. You can make "
"them run a lot faster if you break them down in multiple passes. In a "
"multipass material, each pass takes the result from the previous pass as an "
"input and processes it."
msgstr ""
"像模糊这样的后期处理效果是资源密集型的. 但是如果您在多次通过中将它们分解, 您"
"可以让它们运行得更快. 在多通道材质中, 每次传递都将前一次传递的结果作为输入并"
"对其进行处理."

msgid ""
"To produce a multi-pass post-processing shader, you stack ``CanvasLayer`` "
"and ``ColorRect`` nodes. In the example above, you use a ``CanvasLayer`` "
"object to render a shader using the frame on the layer below. Apart from the "
"node structure, the steps are the same as with the single-pass post-"
"processing shader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an example, you could write a full screen Gaussian blur effect by "
"attaching the following pieces of code to each of the ``ColorRect`` nodes. "
"The order in which you apply the shaders depends on the position of the "
"``CanvasLayer`` in the scene tree, higher means sooner. For this blur "
"shader, the order does not matter."
msgstr ""
"例如，可以通过将下面的代码段附加到每个 ``ColorRect`` 上来编写全屏高斯模糊效"
"果。应用着色器的顺序取决于场景树中 ``CanvasLayer`` 的位置，越往上越早应用。对"
"于这个模糊着色器而言，顺序是无所谓的。"

msgid ""
"Using the above code, you should end up with a full screen blur effect like "
"below."
msgstr "使用上面的代码, 你应该得到如下所示的全屏模糊效果."
