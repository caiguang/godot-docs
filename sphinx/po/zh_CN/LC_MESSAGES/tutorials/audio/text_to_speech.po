"Godot depends on system libraries for text-to-speech functionality. These "
"libraries are installed by default on Windows and macOS, but not on all "

"empty list, indicating that there are no usable voices."

msgid ""
"The best practices for text-to-speech, in terms of the ideal player "
"experience for blind players, is to send output to the player's screen "
"reader. This preserves the choice of language, speed, pitch, etc. that the "
"user set, as well as allows advanced features like allowing players to "
"scroll backward and forward through text. As of now, Godot doesn't provide "
"this level of integration."
msgstr ""
"就盲人玩家的理想游玩体验而言，文本转语音的最佳实践是将输出发送到玩家的屏幕阅"
"读器。这样可以保留用户设定的语言、语速、音调等选择，还可以实现一些高级功能，"
"例如允许玩家在文本中快进和快退。目前，Godot 还没有提供这种级别的集成。"

msgid ""
"With the current state of the Godot text-to-speech APIs, best practices "

msgstr "考虑到 Godot 文本转语音 API 目前的状态，最佳实践包括："

msgid ""
"Develop the game with text-to-speech enabled, and ensure that everything "
"sounds correct"
msgstr "开发游戏时启用文本转语音，确保读音正确"

msgid ""
"Allow players to control which voice to use, and save/persist that selection "
"across game sessions"
msgstr "允许玩家控制使用哪种语音，对选择进行存储/持久化，能够在后续游玩时使用"

msgid ""
"Allow players to control the speech rate, and save/persist that selection "
"across game sessions"
msgstr "允许玩家控制发言的速率，对选择进行存储/持久化，能够在后续游玩时使用"

"This provides your blind players with the most flexibility and comfort "
"available when not using a screen reader, and minimizes the chance of "
"frustrating and alienating them."
msgstr ""
"这样盲人玩家不使用屏幕阅读器也能够达到最灵活舒适的状态，不会让人感到沮丧或者"
"被歧视。"

msgid "Caveats and Other Information"
msgstr "注意事项和其他信息"

msgid ""
"Expect delays when you call `tts_speak` and `tts_stop`. The actual delay "
"time varies depending on both the OS and on your machine's specifications. "
"This is especially critical on Android and Web, where some of the voices "
"depend on web services, and the actual time to playback depends on server "
"load, network latency, and other factors."
msgstr ""
"调用 `tts_speak` 和 `tts_stop` 时会有延迟。实际延迟的时间会根据操作系统和机器"
"的配置而有所不同。在 Android 和 Web 平台尤为明显，因为部分语音基于 Web 服务，"
"播放的实际时间取决于服务器负载、网络延迟等因素。"

msgid ""
"Non-English text works if the correct voices are installed and used. On "
"Windows, you can consult the instructions in `this article`_ to enable "
"additional language voices on Windows."
msgstr ""
"非英语文本需要安装并使用正确语音后才能正常工作。在 Windows 上，可以按照\\ `这"
"篇文章`_\\ 的内容来启用额外语言的语音。"

msgid ""
"Non-ASCII characters, such as umlaut, are pronounced correctly if you select "
"the correct voice."
msgstr "元音变音等非 ASCII 字符的正确发音需要选择正确的语音。"

msgid ""
"Blind players use a number of screen readers, including JAWS, NVDA, "
"VoiceOver, Narrator, and more."
msgstr ""
"盲人玩家使用的屏幕阅读器有很多种，包括 JAWS、NVDA、VoiceOver、Narrator 等。"

msgid ""
"Windows text-to-speech APIs generally perform better than their equivalents "
"on other systems (e.g. `tts_stop` followed by `tts_speak` immediately speaks "
"the new message)."
msgstr ""
"Windows 文本转语音 API 的性能通常比其他系统中对应的 API 要好（例如 "
"``tts_stop`` 后跟 ``tts_speak`` 能够立即朗读新消息）。"
