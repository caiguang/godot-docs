msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Godot's audio processing code has been written with games in mind, with the "
"aim of achieving an optimal balance between performance and sound quality."
msgstr "Godot的音频处理代码是为了游戏而写的, 以达到性能和音质之间的最佳平衡."

msgid ""
"Godot's audio engine allows any number of audio buses to be created and any "
"number of effect processors can be added to each bus. Only the hardware of "
"the device running your game will limit the number of buses and effects that "
"can be used before performance starts to suffer."
msgstr ""
"Godot的音频引擎允许创建任意数量的音频总线, 并且可以向每个总线添加任意数量的效"
"果处理器. 运行游戏的设备的硬件会限制总线的数量, 以及在性能开始下降之前可以使"
"用的效果."

msgid "Decibel scale"
msgstr "分贝标度"

msgid ""
"Godot's sound interface is designed to meet the expectations of sound design "
"professionals. To this end, it primarily uses the decibel scale."
msgstr ""
"Godot的声音界面是为了满足声音设计专业人士的期望而设计的. 因此主要采用分贝标"
"度."

msgid "For those unfamiliar with it, it can be explained with a few facts:"
msgstr "对于那些不熟悉它的人, 可以用一些事实来解释:"

msgid ""
"The decibel (dB) scale is a relative scale. It represents the ratio of sound "
"power by using 20 times the base 10 logarithm of the ratio (20 × log\\ :sub:"
"`10`\\ (P/P\\ :sub:`0`\\ ))."
msgstr ""
"分贝(dB)标度是一个相对标度. 它等于声功率比的常用对数的20倍(20 × log\\ :sub:"
"`10`\\ (P/P/\\ :sub:`0`\\ ))."

msgid ""
"For every 6 dB, sound amplitude doubles or halves. 12 dB represents a factor "
"of 4, 18 dB a factor of 8, 20 dB a factor of 10, 40 dB a factor of 100, etc."
msgstr ""
"每增/减6分贝, 声幅就会加倍/减半.12dB代表系数4,18dB代表系数8,20dB代表系数"
"10,40dB代表系数100, 以此类推."

msgid ""
"Since the scale is logarithmic, true zero (no audio) can't be represented."
msgstr "由于比例是对数的, 因此无法表示真零(无音频)."

msgid ""
"0 dB is the maximum amplitude possible in a digital audio system. This limit "
"is not the human limit, but a limit from the sound hardware. Audio with "
"amplitudes that are too high to be represented properly below 0 dB create a "
"kind of distortion called *clipping*."
msgstr ""
"0 dB 是数字音频系统中可能的最大振幅. 这个限制不是人为的限制, 而是声音硬件的限"
"制. 因振幅太高而无法完全反映在0dB以下的音频, 会产生一种被称为 *削波* 的失真."

msgid ""
"To avoid clipping, your sound mix should be arranged so that the output of "
"the *master bus* (more on that later) never exceeds 0 dB."
msgstr ""
"为了避免削波，你应该调整混音，使\\ *master 总线*\\ （后面会有更多的介绍）永远"
"不超过 0 dB。"

msgid ""
"Every 6 dB below the 0 dB limit, sound energy is *halved*. It means the "
"sound volume at -6 dB is half as loud as 0dB. -12 dB is half as loud as -6 "
"dB and so on."
msgstr ""
"低于0dB限制的每6dB, 声能就会 *减半* . 这意味着-6dB的音量是0dB的一半. -12dB"
"是-6dB的一半, 依此类推."

msgid ""
"When working with decibels, sound is considered no longer audible between "
"-60 dB and -80 dB. This makes your working range generally between -60 dB "
"and 0 dB."
msgstr ""
"使用分贝时, -60dB和-80dB范围内的声音被认为是听不见的. 也就是说你的工作范围一"
"般在-60dB和0dB之间."

msgid ""
"This can take a bit getting used to, but it's friendlier in the end and will "
"allow you to communicate better with audio professionals."
msgstr ""
"这可能需要一点时间来习惯, 但最终会变得友好, 并且可以让你与音频专业人员更好地"
"进行交流."

msgid "Audio buses can be found in the bottom panel of the Godot editor:"
msgstr "音频总线可以在Godot 编辑器的底部面板中找到:"

msgid ""
"An *audio bus* (also called an *audio channel*) can be considered a place "
"that audio is channeled through on the way to playback through a device's "
"speakers. Audio data can be *modified* and *re-routed* by an audio bus. An "
"audio bus has a VU meter (the bars that light up when sound is played) which "
"indicates the amplitude of the signal passing through."
msgstr ""
"*音频总线* (audio bus)(通常也称为 *音频通道* (audio channel) )是音频从扬声器"
"播放出来之前通过的地方. 它可以 *修改* 和 *重路由* 音频数据. 音频总线有一个 VU"
"表(播放声音时亮起的条形), 表示通过的信号的幅度."

msgid ""
"The leftmost bus is the *master bus*. This bus outputs the mix to your "
"speakers so, as mentioned in the *Decibel scale* section above, make sure "
"that your mix level doesn't reach 0 dB in this bus. The rest of the audio "
"buses can be flexibly routed. After modifying the sound, they send it to "
"another bus to the left. The destination bus can be specified for each of "
"the non-master audio buses. Routing always passes audio from buses on the "
"right to buses further to the left. This avoids infinite routing loops."
msgstr ""
"最左边的总线是 *主总线* . 此总线将混音输出到你的扬声器, 因此, 正如之前 *分贝"
"标度* 部分所述, 请确保主总线中的混音水平永远低于 0 dB. 其余的音频总线可以灵活"
"地进行路由. 在修改声音后, 它们会将其发送到左边的另一条总线上. 非主总线的目标"
"总线可以被单独设置. 而右侧总线的音频会被路由至左侧总线, 这避免了无限循环."

msgid ""
"In the above image, the output of *Bus 2* has been routed to the *Master* "
"bus."
msgstr "在上图中, *Bus 2* 的输出被路由到了 *主* 总线."

msgid "Playback of audio through a bus"
msgstr "通过总线播放音频"

msgid ""
"To test passing audio to a bus, create an AudioStreamPlayer node, load an "
"AudioStream and select a target bus for playback:"
msgstr ""
"要测试将音频传递到总线, 请创建AudioStreamPlayer节点, 加载AudioStream并选择要"
"播放的目标总线:"

msgid "Finally, toggle the **Playing** property to **On** and sound will flow."
msgstr "最后将 **Playing** 属性勾上 **On** , 声音就开始播放了."

msgid ""
"You may also be interested in reading about :ref:`doc_audio_streams` now."
msgstr "你现在可能有兴趣阅读 :ref:`doc_audio_streams`。"

msgid "Adding effects"
msgstr "添加特效"

msgid ""
"Audio buses can contain all sorts of effects. These effects modify the sound "
"in one way or another and are applied in order."
msgstr "音频总线可以包含各种效果. 这些效果以某种方式修改声音并按顺序应用."

msgid "For information on what each effect does, see :ref:`doc_audio_effects`."
msgstr "有关每种效果效果的作用的信息，请参见 :ref:`doc_audio_effects`。"

msgid "Automatic bus disabling"
msgstr "自动总线禁用"

msgid ""
"There is no need to disable buses manually when not in use. Godot detects "
"that the bus has been silent for a few seconds and disables it (including "
"all effects)."
msgstr ""
"你不需要手动禁用闲置总线,Godot在检测到总线已经静音数秒之后, 就会禁用它(以及所"
"有效果)."

msgid "Disabled buses have a blue VU meter instead of a red-green one."
msgstr "已禁用的总线VU表为蓝色, 而不是红绿色."

msgid "Bus rearrangement"
msgstr "总线重排"

msgid ""
"Stream Players use bus names to identify a bus, which allows adding, "
"removing and moving buses around while the reference to them is kept. "
"However, if a bus is renamed, the reference will be lost and the Stream "
"Player will output to Master. This system was chosen because rearranging "
"buses is a more common process than renaming them."
msgstr ""
"流播放器使用总线名称来识别总线, 允许在保留对总线的引用时添加, 删除和移动总"
"线. 然而, 重命名总线会导致引用丢失, 流播放器将输出到主总线. 之所以选择这个系"
"统, 是因为重新排列总线相比重命名总线更为常用."

msgid "Default bus layout"
msgstr "默认总线布局"

msgid ""
"The default bus layout is automatically saved to the ``res://"
"default_bus_layout.tres`` file. Custom bus arrangements can be saved and "
"loaded from disk."
msgstr ""
"默认的总线布局会自动保存到 ``res:// default_bus_layout.tres`` 文件中. 自定义"
"总线布局可以从磁盘中保存和加载."

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
