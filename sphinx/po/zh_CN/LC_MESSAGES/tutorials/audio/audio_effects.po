msgid "Audio effects"
msgstr "音频特效"

msgid ""
"Godot includes several audio effects that can be added to an audio bus to "
"alter every sound file that goes through that bus."
msgstr ""
"Godot 包含多种音频效果，可以将它们添加到音频总线以更改通过该总线的每个音频文"
"件。"

msgid ""
"Try them all out to get a sense of how they alter sound. Here follows a "
"short description of the available effects:"
msgstr "全部试一试，感受声音的改变。下面是对以上效果的简短描述:"

msgid "Amplify"
msgstr "增幅(Amplify)"

msgid ""
"Amplify changes the volume of the signal. Some care needs to be taken, "
"though: setting the level too high can make the sound digitally clip, which "
"can produce unpleasant crackles and pops."
msgstr ""
"增幅改变信号的音量。不过使用时要小心：把电平调得太高的话，声音就会出现数字削"
"波，从而产生令人不愉快的爆裂声和爆裂声。"

msgid "BandLimit and BandPass"
msgstr "带限和带通(BandLimit and BandPass)"

msgid ""
"These are resonant filters which block frequencies around the *Cutoff* "
"point. BandPass can be used to simulate sound passing through an old "
"telephone line or megaphone. Modulating the BandPass frequency can simulate "
"the sound of a wah-wah guitar pedal, think of the guitar in Jimi Hendrix's "
"*Voodoo Child (Slight Return)*."
msgstr ""
"它们是共振滤波器，在 *截断* (Cutoff)点附近阻断频率。带通滤波器可以用来模拟旧"
"电话线路或扩音器传出的声音。调节带通滤波器的频率，可以模拟吉他哇音(wah-wah)踏"
"板的声音，想想吉米·亨德里克斯在 *Voodoo Child (Slight Return)* 中使用的吉他"
"吧。"

msgid "Capture"
msgstr "捕获"

msgid ""
"The Capture effect copies the audio frames of the audio bus that it is on "
"into an internal buffer. This can be used to capture data from the "
"microphone or to transmit audio over the network in real-time."
msgstr ""
"Capture（采集）效果器会将其所在音频总线的音频帧复制到内部缓冲区中。可用于从麦"
"克风获取音频或通过网络实时传输音频。"

msgid "Chorus"
msgstr "和声（Chorus）"

msgid ""
"As the name of the effect implies, the Chorus effect makes a single audio "
"sample sound like an entire chorus. It does this by duplicating a signal and "
"very slightly altering the timing and pitch of each duplicate, and varying "
"that over time via an LFO (low frequency oscillator). The duplicate(s) are "
"then mixed back together with the original signal, producing a lush, wide, "
"and large sound. Although chorus is traditionally used for voices, it can be "
"desirable with almost any type of sound."
msgstr ""
"正如该效果的名称所暗示的那样，和声效果将使单个音频样本听起来像整个合唱。它通"
"过复制信号并稍微改变每个副本的时间和音高，并通过 LFO（低频振荡器）随时间变化"
"来实现此目的。然后，复制信号与原始信号混合在一起，产生丰富、宽广、宏大的声"
"音。尽管和声传统上用于声音，但几乎任何类型的声音都可以使用和声。"

msgid "Compressor"
msgstr "压缩(Compressor)"

msgid ""
"A dynamic range compressor automatically attenuates (ducks) the level of the "
"incoming signal when its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The level of "
"attenuation applied is proportional to how far the incoming audio exceeds "
"the threshold. The compressor's Ratio parameter controls the degree of "
"attenuation. One of the main uses of a compressor is to reduce the dynamic "
"range of signals with very loud and quiet parts. Reducing the dynamic range "
"of a signal can make it fit more comfortably in a mix."
msgstr ""
"当输入信号的幅度超过某一阈值时，动态范围压缩器会自动衰减（避开）该信号的电"
"平。衰减的程度与传入的音频超过阈值的程度成正比。压缩器的 \"比例\" 参数控制衰"
"减的系数。压缩器的主要用途之一是，一个信号具有非常大声和小声的部分时，压缩器"
"可以用于降低动态范围。降低信号的动态范围会更方便混音。"

msgid "The compressor has many uses. For example:"
msgstr "压缩器有很多用途，例如:"

msgid ""
"It can be used in the Master bus to compress the whole output prior to being "
"hit by a limiter, making the effect of the limiter much more subtle."
msgstr ""
"它可以在主总线中使用，在受到限制器影响之前压缩整个输出，从而使限制器的效果更"
"加微妙。"

msgid ""
"It can be used in voice channels to ensure they sound as even as possible."
msgstr "它可以在人声通道中使用，使它们听起来尽可能均匀。"

msgid ""
"It can be *sidechained* by another sound source. This means it can reduce "
"the sound level of one signal using the level of another audio bus for "
"threshold detection. This technique is very common in video game mixing to "
"\"duck\" the level of music or sound effects when in-game or multiplayer "
"voices need to be fully audible."
msgstr ""
"它可以通过另一个声源来 *侧链* (Sidechain)。也就是说, 它可以利用另一个音频总线"
"的电平进行阈值检测，来降低一个信号的电平。这种技术在电子游戏混音中非常常见。"
"当游戏中或多人游戏的声音需要被玩家清楚听到时，音乐或音效的电平会被 \"降低"
"\"（Duck）。"

msgid ""
"It can accentuate transients by using a slower attack. This can make sound "
"effects more punchy."
msgstr "它可以通过较慢的启动(attack)来突出瞬态，让音效听起来更有力。"

msgid ""
"If your goal is to prevent a signal from exceeding a given amplitude "
"altogether, rather than to reduce the dynamic range of the signal, a :ref:"
"`limiter <doc_audio_buses_limiter>` is likely a better choice than a "
"compressor for this purpose. However, applying compression before a limiter "
"is still good practice."
msgstr ""
"如果你的目标是防止电平信号超过某个给定幅度，而不是减少信号的动态范围，那"
"么， :ref:`限幅器（limiter）<doc_audio_buses_limiter>` 可能是比用于此目的的压"
"缩器更好的选择。然而，在限幅器之前应用压缩依然是很好的实践。"

msgid "Delay"
msgstr "延迟(Delay)"

msgid ""
"Digital delay essentially duplicates a signal and repeats it at a specified "
"speed with a volume level that decays for each repeat. Delay is great for "
"simulating the acoustic space of a canyon or large room, where sound bounces "
"have a lot of *delay* between their repeats. This is in contrast to reverb, "
"which has a more natural and blurred sound to it. Using this in conjunction "
"with reverb can create very natural sounding environments!"
msgstr ""
"数字延迟本质上是复制一个信号，并以指定的速度重复播放它，且每次重复时音量都会"
"衰减。延迟非常适合模拟如峡谷或大房间这样的声学空间，其中声音的反弹在每次重复"
"之间都有很多 *延迟* 。这点与混响相反，混响的声音更自然、更模糊。将其与混响结"
"合使用可以创建非常自然的声音环境！"

msgid "Distortion"
msgstr "失真(Distortion)"

msgid "Makes the sound distorted. Godot offers several types of distortion:"
msgstr "使声音失真。 Godot 提供了几种类型的失真："

msgid ""
"*Overdrive* sounds like a guitar distortion pedal or megaphone. Sounds "
"distorted with this sound like they're coming through a low-quality speaker "
"or device."
msgstr ""
"*过载* （Overdrive）听起来像吉他失真踏板或扩音器。这种声音听起来就像是通过低"
"质量的扬声器或设备发出的一样。"

msgid "*Tan* sounds like another interesting flavor of overdrive."
msgstr "*正弦* （Tan）听起来像是另一种有趣的过载风格。"

msgid ""
"*Bit crushing* clamps the amplitude of the signal, making it sound flat and "
"crunchy."
msgstr "*位破碎* （Bit crushing）会限制信号的幅度，使其听起来平坦且嘎吱作响。"

msgid ""
"All three types of distortion can add higher frequency sounds to an original "
"sound, making it stand out better in a mix."
msgstr ""
"所有这三种类型的失真都可以在原始声音中添加更高频率的声音，使其在混音中更加突"
"出。"

msgid "EQ"
msgstr "均衡器(EQ)"

msgid ""
"EQ is what all other equalizers inherit from. It can be extended with Custom "
"scripts to create an equalizer with a custom number of bands."
msgstr ""
"所有其他均衡器都从EQ继承而来。可以使用自定义脚本将其扩展，以此创建具有自定义"
"频段数的均衡器。"

msgid "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"
msgstr "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Godot provides three equalizers with different numbers of bands, which are "
"represented in the title (6, 10, and 21 bands, respectively). An equalizer "
"on the Master bus can be useful for cutting low and high frequencies that "
"the device's speakers can't reproduce well. For example, phone or tablet "
"speakers usually don't reproduce low frequency sounds well, and could make a "
"limiter or compressor attenuate sounds that aren't even audible to the user "
"anyway."
msgstr ""
"Godot提供三个具有不同频带数的均衡器。主总线上的均衡器可以有效地削减设备扬声器"
"不能很好地再现的频率(例如, 手机扬声器不能很好地再现低音部分)。插入耳机时可以"
"禁用均衡器效果."

msgid ""
"Note: The equalizer effect can be disabled when headphones are plugged in, "
"giving the user the best of both worlds."
msgstr "注意：插入耳机时可以禁用均衡器效果，为用户提供两全其美的效果。"

msgid "Filter"
msgstr "过滤器"

msgid ""
"Filter is what all other filters inherit from and should not be used "
"directly."
msgstr "滤波器是所有其他处理器继承自的效果，不能直接使用。"

msgid "HighPassFilter"
msgstr "高通滤波器( HighPassFilter)"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency. HighPassFilter is used "
"to reduce the bass content of a signal."
msgstr ""
"这些滤波器削减低于特定 *截断* 频率的频率. 高通滤波器用于降低信号的低音含量。"

msgid "HighShelfFilter"
msgstr "高架滤波器(HighShelfFilter)"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "减少所有高于特定 *截断* 值的频率。"

msgid "Limiter"
msgstr "限幅器(Limiter)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"A limiter is similar to a compressor, but it's less flexible and designed to "
"prevent a signal's amplitude exceeding a given dB threshold. Adding a "
"limiter to the final point of the Master bus is good practice, as it offers "
"an easy safeguard against clipping."
msgstr ""
"限幅器类似于压缩器，但灵活性较差，功能是限制声音不能超过给定的dB阈值。在主总"
"线上添加一个限制器是防止削波的防护措施。"

msgid "LowPassFilter"
msgstr "低通滤波器(LowPassFilter)"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency and can also resonate "
"(boost frequencies close to the *Cutoff* frequency). Low pass filters can be "
"used to simulate \"muffled\" sound. For instance, underwater sounds, sounds "
"blocked by walls, or distant sounds."
msgstr ""
"削减高于特定 *截断* 频率的频率，也可以产生共振(加强接近 *截断* 频率的频率)。"
"低通滤波器可以用来模拟 \"沉闷\" 的声音。例如，水下的声音, 墙后的声音或遥远的"
"声音。"

msgid "LowShelfFilter"
msgstr "低架过滤器(LowShelfFilter)"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "削减所有低于特定 *截断* 值的频率。"

msgid "NotchFilter"
msgstr "陷波滤波器(NotchFilter)"

msgid ""
"The opposite of the BandPassFilter, it removes a band of sound from the "
"frequency spectrum at a given *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "与带通滤波器相反, 它从频谱中的给定的 *截断* 处移除一个频段的声音."

msgid "Panner"
msgstr "声像(Panner)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The Panner allows the stereo balance of a signal to be adjusted between the "
"left and right channels. Headphones are recommended when configuring in this "
"effect."
msgstr "声像效果允许在左右通道之间调整信号的立体声平衡(戴上耳机试听这个效果)。"

msgid "Phaser"
msgstr "移相器(Phaser)"

msgid ""
"This effect is formed by de-phasing two duplicates of the same sound so they "
"cancel each other out in an interesting way. Phaser produces a pleasant "
"whooshing sound that moves back and forth through the audio spectrum, and "
"can be a great way to create sci-fi effects or Darth Vader-like voices."
msgstr ""
"这种效果是通过对同一声音的两个副本进行移相而形成的，因此，它们会以一种有趣的"
"方式相互抵消。 移相器会产生令人愉悦的嘶嘶声，在音频频谱中来回移动，如果你要创"
"建科幻风格效果或达斯·维德（Darth Vader）那般的声音，移相器是个好选择。"

msgid "PitchShift"
msgstr "移调(PitchShift)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"This effect allows the adjustment of the signal's pitch independently of its "
"speed. All frequencies can be increased/decreased with minimal effect on "
"transients. PitchShift can be useful to create unusually high or deep "
"voices. Do note that altering pitch can sound unnatural when pushed outside "
"of a narrow window."
msgstr ""
"这种效果允许在不改变速度的前提下改变音调，可以用对瞬态的影响最小的方式增/减所"
"有频率，移调可以用来创作特别尖锐或低沉的声音。"

msgid "The Record effect allows the user to record sound from a microphone."
msgstr "Record 效果允许用户录制麦克风中的声音。"

msgid "Reverb"
msgstr "混响(Reverb)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Reverb simulates rooms of different sizes. It has adjustable parameters that "
"can be tweaked to obtain the sound of a specific room. Reverb is commonly "
"outputted from :ref:`Area3Ds <class_Area3D>` (see :ref:`Reverb buses "
"<doc_audio_streams_reverb_buses>`), or to apply a \"chamber\" feel to all "
"sounds."
msgstr ""
"混响可以模拟不同大小的房间. 可以调整各种参数以获得特定房间的声效. 混响通常"
"从 :ref:`Areas <class_Area>` 输出(见 :ref:`Reverb buses "

msgid "SpectrumAnalyzer"
msgstr "频谱分析仪(SpectrumAnalyzer)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"This effect doesn't alter audio, instead, you add this effect to buses you "
"want a spectrum analysis of. This would typically be used for audio "
"visualization. Visualizing voices can be a great way to draw attention to "
"them without just increasing their volume. A demo project using this can be "
"found `here <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/"
