msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"When creating a game, the process of localization usually starts when "
"development has finished. This means that translations aren't available "
"during development for testing whether the project is internationalized "
"properly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot offers pseudolocalization as a way to test how robust the project is "
"when it comes to locale changes. Pseudolocalization simulates changes that "
"might take place during localization. This way, any issues regarding "
"internationalization can be recognized early on during development."

"You can see how pseudolocalization works in action using the "
"`Pseudolocalizaton demo project <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-"
"projects/tree/master/gui/pseudolocalization>`__."

"如果您更善于通过查看示例学习，可以在\\ `这里 <https://github.com/godotengine/"

msgid "Enabling and configuring pseudolocalization"
msgstr "伪本地化的启用和配置"

msgid ""
"Enabling pseudolocalization and the configurations related to it is as "
"simple as toggling a checkbox in the project settings. These settings can be "
"found in **Project → Project Settings → General → Internationalization → "
"Pseudolocalization** after enabling the **Advanced** toggle in the project "
"settings dialog:"

"Pseudolocalization can also be :ref:`toggled at runtime from a script "
"<doc_pseudolocalization_runtime>`."

msgid "Pseudolocalization configurations"
msgstr "伪本地化配置"

msgid ""
"Pseudolocalization in Godot can be set up according to the specific use case "
"of the project. Here are the pseudolocalization properties that can be "
"configured through project settings:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``replace_with_accents``: Replaces all characters in the string with their "
"accented variants. *\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\"* will "
"be converted to *\"Ŧh̀é q́üíćḱ ḅŕôŵή f́ôx́ ǰüm̀ṕéd́ ôṽéŕ ŧh̀é łáźý d́ôǵ\"* when this "
"setting is enabled. This can be used to spot untranslated strings that won't "
"have accents, but is also useful to check for missing glyphs in the font(s) "
"used by the project."
msgstr ""
"``replace_with_accents``：将字符串中的所有字母替换为其重音变体。 启用此设定"
"后，*\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\"* 会被转换为 *\"Ŧh̀é "
"q́üíćḱ ḅŕôŵή f́ôx́ ǰüm̀ṕéd́ ôṽéŕ ŧh̀é łáźý d́ôǵ\"*。 这可用于发现没有重音的未翻译字"
"符串，对于检查项目使用的字体是否缺少字形也很有用。"

msgid ""
"``double_vowels``: Doubles all the vowels in the string. It is a good "
"approximation to simulate expansion of text during localization. This can be "
"used to check for text that would overflow its container (such as buttons)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``fake_bidi``: Fake bidirectional text (simulates right-to-left text). This "
"is useful to simulate right-to-left writing systems to check for potential "
"layout issues that would occur in languages using right-to-left scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``override``: Replaces all the characters in the string with an asterisk "
"(``*``). This is useful for quickly finding text that isn't being localized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``expansion_ratio``: Can be used in cases where doubling the vowels isn't a "
"sufficient approximation. This setting pads the string with underscores "
"(``_``) and expands it by the given ratio. An expansion ratio of ``0.3`` is "
"sufficient for most practical cases; it will increase the length of the "
"string by 30%."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``prefix`` and ``suffix``: These properties can be used to specify a prefix "
"and suffix to wrap the text in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``skip_placeholders``: Skips placeholders for string formatting like ``%s`` "
"and ``%f``. This is useful to identify places where more arguments are "
"required for the formatted string to display correctly."

"All of these properties can be toggled as needed according to the project's "
"use case."
msgstr "可以通过代码配置这些属性，也可以在“检查器”中对其进行编辑。"

msgid "Configuring pseudolocalization at runtime"
msgstr "运行时配置伪本地化"

msgid ""
"Pseudolocalization can be toggled at runtime using the :ref:"
"`pseudolocalization_enabled<class_TranslationServer_property_pseudolocalization_enabled>` "
"property in TranslationServer. However, if runtime configuration of "
"pseudolocalization properties is required, they can be directly configured "
"using :ref:`ProjectSettings.set_setting(property, value) "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_set_setting>` and then calling :ref:"
"`TranslationServer.reload_pseudolocalization() "
"<class_TranslationServer_method_reload_pseudolocalization>` which reparses "
"the pseudolocalization properties and reloads the pseudolocalization. The "
"following code snippet shall turn on ``replace_with_accents`` and "
"``double_vowels`` properties and then call ``reload_pseudolocalization()`` "
"for the changes to get reflected::"
