"Out of the box Godot gives you all the basic support to setup an XR project. "
"XR specific game mechanics however need to be implemented on top of this "
"foundation. While Godot makes this relatively easy this can still be a "
"daunting task."

"For this reason Godot has developed a toolkit called `Godot XR Tools "
"<https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools>`_ that implements many of the "
"basic mechanics found in XR games, from locomotion to object interaction to "
"UI interaction."
msgstr ""
"`Godot XR 工具 <https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools>`__\\ 是一个包含了"
"若干实用子场景的插件，可以用来快速实现移动、对象交互、UI 元素等 XR 体验。"

msgid ""
"This toolkit is designed to work with both OpenXR and WebXR runtimes. We'll "
"be using this as a base for our documentation here. It helps developers hit "
"the ground running but for more specific use cases building your own logic "
"is just as valid. In that case XR tools can help in providing inspiration."

msgid ""
"The current stable release of Godot XR Tools available on the Asset Library "
"is the version for Godot 3. The port of Godot XR Tools for Godot 4 is "
"available for download from the github website. We will walk through the "
"step of downloading and installing it here. We will update the documentation "
"once Godot XR Tools becomes available for Godot 4 through the asset library."

"``addons`` folder. It is this folder that you want to copy in its entirety "
"to your Godot project folder, your project should now look something like "
"this:"

"OpenXR supports full hand tracking however there currently are significant "
"differences in capabilities between the different XR Runtimes."

"As a reliable alternative Godot XR Tools comes with a number of rigged hand "
"scenes that react on trigger and grip inputs of your controller. These hands "
"come in low and high poly versions, come in a few configurations, a number "
"of animation files to control finger positions and a number of different "
"textures."

msgid ""
"As you can see from the path of this scene, low poly models are in the "
"``lowpoly`` subfolder while high poly models are in the ``highpoly`` "
"subfolder. You will want to use the low poly versions if you plan to release "
"your game on mobile devices."

msgstr "我们选择的手默认只是一个手。其他选项包括："

msgid "tac_glove - the hand is wearing a glove with fingers exposed"

msgid "full_glove - the hand is wearing a glove that covers the entire hand"
