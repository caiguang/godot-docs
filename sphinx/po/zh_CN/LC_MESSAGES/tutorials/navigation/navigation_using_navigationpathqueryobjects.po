msgstr "使用 NavigationPathQueryObject"

msgid ""
"``NavigationPathQueryObjects`` can be used together with ``NavigationServer."
"query_path()`` to obtain a heavily **customized** navigation path including "
"optional **meta data** about the path."
msgstr ""
"``NavigationPathQueryObjects`` 即导航路径查询对象，可以与 ``NavigationServer."
"query_path()`` 配合使用，对获取的导航路径进行丰富的\\ **自定义**\\ ，指定包括"
"\\ **元数据**\\ 在内的各种项目。"

msgid ""
"This requires more setup compared to obtaining a normal NavigationPath but "
"lets you tailor the pathfinding and provided path data to the different "
"needs of a project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationPathQueryObjects consist of a pair of objects, a "
"``NavigationPathQueryParameters`` object holding the customization options "
"for the query and a ``NavigationPathQueryResult`` that receives (regular) "
"updates with the resulting path and meta data from the query."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2D and 3D versions of ``NavigationPathQueryParameters`` are available as :"
"ref:`NavigationPathQueryParameters2D<class_NavigationPathQueryParameters2D>` "
"and :ref:"
"`NavigationPathQueryParameters3D<class_NavigationPathQueryParameters3D>` "
"respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2D and 3D versions of ``NavigationPathQueryResult`` are available as :ref:"
"`NavigationPathQuerResult2D<class_NavigationPathQueryResult2D>` and :ref:"
"`NavigationPathQueryResult3D<class_NavigationPathQueryResult3D>` "
"respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both parameters and result are used as a pair with the ``NavigationServer."
"query_path()`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the available customization options and their use see the class doc of "
"the parameters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While not a strict requirement, both objects are intended to be created once "
"in advance, stored in a persistent variable for the agent and reused for "
"every followup path query with updated parameters. This reuse avoids "
"performance implications from frequent object creation if a project has a "
"large quantity of simultaneous agents that regularly update their paths."
