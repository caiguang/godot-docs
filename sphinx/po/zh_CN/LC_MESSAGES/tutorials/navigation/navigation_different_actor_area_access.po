msgid "Support different actor area access"

msgid ""
"A typical example for different area access in gameplay are doors that "
"connect rooms with different navigation meshes and are not accessible by all "
"actors all the time."
msgstr ""
"如果要举一个游戏中不同区域访问权限的例子，那通常就是连接房间的门，不同的房间"
"使用不同的导航网格，不是所有角色、所有时间都能够进入这扇门。"

msgid ""
"Add a NavigationRegion at the door position. Add an appropriate navigation "
"mesh the size of the door that can connect with the surrounding navigation "
"meshes. In order to control access, enable / disable navigation layer bits "
"so path queries that use the same navigation layer bits can find a path "
"through the \"door\" navigation mesh."
msgstr ""
"在门的位置添加一个 NavigationRegion。添加一个合适的导航网格，大小和门一样，能"
"够连接附近的导航网格。控制访问权限就是启动/禁用某个导航层，这样路径查询时使用"
"相同的导航层就能够查找出经过“门”的导航网格的路径。"

msgid ""
"The bitmask can act as a set of door keys or abilities and only actors with "
"at least one matching and enabled bit layer in their pathfinding query will "
"find a path through this region. See :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_advanced_using_navigationlayers` for more information on how "
"to work with navigation layers and the bitmask."
msgstr ""
"位掩码可以充当一组门钥匙或者能力，只有与启用的层中存在至少一个匹配，寻路查询"
"才能够找出经过这个区块的路径。详见 :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_advanced_using_navigationlayers`\\ ，介绍了导航层和导航遮罩的"
"使用。"

msgid ""
"The entire \"door\" region can also be enabled / disable if required but if "
"disabled will block access for all path queries."
msgstr ""
"如果需要，也可以启用/禁用整个“门”的区块，但禁用后会阻止所有路径查询访问该区"
"块。"

msgid ""
"Prefer working with navigation layers in path queries whenever possible as "
"enabling or disabling navigation layers on a region triggers a costly "
"recalculation of the navigation map connections."
msgstr ""
"请尽量优先选择在路径查询中使用导航层，因为启用和禁用区块的导航层会触发导航地"
"图连接的重新计算，性能开销很大。"

msgid ""
"Changing navigation layers will only affect new path queries but not "
"automatically update existing paths."
msgstr "更改导航层只会影响新的路径查询，不会自动更新已有路径。"
