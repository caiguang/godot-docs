msgid "Using NavigationObstacles"
msgstr "使用 NavigationObstacle"

msgid ""
"NavigationObstacles can be used either as static or dynamic obstacles to "
"affect avoidance controlled agents."
msgstr ""
"NavigationObstacle 即导航障碍物，可以用作静态或动态障碍物，影响由避障系统控制"
"的代理。"

msgid ""
"When used statically NavigationObstacles constrain avoidance controlled "
"agents outside or inside a polygon defined area."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When used dynamically NavigationObstacles push away avoidance controlled "
"agents in a radius around them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2D and 3D versions of NavigationObstacles nodes are available as :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle2D<class_NavigationObstacle2D>` and :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle3D<class_NavigationObstacle3D>`  respectively."
msgstr ""
"2D 和 3D 版本的 NavigationObstacle 节点分别为 :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle2D<class_NavigationObstacle2D>` 和 :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle3D<class_NavigationObstacle3D>`\\ 。"

msgid ""
"NavigationObstacles do not change or influence the pathfinding in any way. "
"NavigationObstacles only affect the avoidance velocities of agents "
"controlled by avoidance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Static obstacles"
msgstr "静态障碍物"

msgid ""
"A NavigationObstacle is considered static when its ``vertices`` property is "
"populated with an outline array of positions to form a polygon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Static obstacles act as hard do-not-cross boundaries for avoidance using "
"agents, e.g. similar to physics collision but for avoidance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Static obstacles define their boundaries with an array of outline "
"``vertices`` (positions), and in case of 3D with an additional ``height`` "
"property."
msgstr ""

msgid "Static obstacles only work for agents that use the 2D avoidance mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Static obstacles define through winding order of the vertices if agents are "
"pushed out or sucked in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Static obstacles can not change their position. They can only be warped to a "
"new position and rebuild from scratch. Static obstacles as a result are ill-"
"suited for usages where the position is changed every frame as the constant "
"rebuild has a high performance cost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Static obstacles that are warped to another position can not be predicted by "
"agents. This creates the risk of getting agents stuck should a static "
"obstacle be warped on top of agents."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the 2D avoidance is used in 3D the y-axis of Vector3 vertices is "
"ignored. Instead, the global y-axis position of the obstacle is used as the "
"elevation level. Agents will ignore static obstacles in 3D that are below or "
"above them. This is automatically determined by global y-axis position of "
"both obstacle and agent as the elevation level as well as their respective "
"height properties."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dynamic obstacles"
msgstr "动态障碍物"

msgid ""
"A NavigationObstacle is considered dynamic when its ``radius`` property is "
"greater than zero."
msgstr "NavigationObstacle 的 ``radius`` 属性大于零时就会被认为是动态障碍物。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles act as a soft please-move-away-from-me object for "
"avoidance using agents, e.g. similar to how they avoid other agents."
msgstr ""
"对于启用了避障的代理而言，动态障碍物就是一个“请离我远点”的对象，类似于它们自"
"己躲避其他代理的行为。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles define their boundaries with a single ``radius`` for a 2D "
"circle, or in case of 3D avoidance a sphere shape."
msgstr "动态障碍物使用 ``radius`` 半径来定义边界，2D 中是圆形，3D 中是球形。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles can change their position every frame without additional "
"performance cost."
msgstr "动态障碍物每一帧都可以改变位置，不会有额外的性能开销。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles with a set velocity can be predicted in their movement by "
"agents."
msgstr "动态障碍物设置速度后，其他代理就能够预测移动。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles are not a reliable way to constrain agents in crowded or "
"narrow spaces."
msgstr "动态障碍物不适合用来将代理限制在拥挤、狭窄的空间中。"

msgid ""
"While both static and dynamic properties can be active at the same time on "
"the same obstacle this is not recommended for performance. Ideally when an "
"obstacle is moving the static vertices are removed and instead the radius "
"activated. When the obstacle reaches the new final position it should "
"gradually enlarge its radius to push all other agents away. With enough "
"created save space around the obstacle it should add the static vertices "
"again and remove the radius. This helps to avoid getting agents stuck in the "
"suddenly appearing static obstacle when the rebuild static boundary is "
"finished."
msgstr ""
"虽然障碍物可以同时激活静态和动态属性，但是出于性能的考虑不建议这么做。理想情"
"况下，障碍物移动时，应该把静态顶点移除、激活半径。障碍物到达目的地后，应该逐"
"步增大半径，将其他代理推开。在障碍物的周围创造出足够大的安全区域后，就应该把"
"静态顶点添加回来、移除半径。这样就能够避免重建静态边界后，代理因为静态障碍物"
"的突然出现而被卡住。"

msgid ""
"Similar to agents the obstacles can make use of the ``avoidance_layers`` "
"bitmask. All agents with a matching bit on their own avoidance mask will "
"avoid the obstacle."
msgstr ""
"和代理类似，障碍物也能够使用 ``avoidance_layers`` 位掩码。自身的避障掩码中与"
"之存在匹配位的代理都会躲避这个障碍物。"

msgid "Procedual obstacles"
msgstr "程序式障碍物"

msgid ""
"New obstacles can be created without a Node directly on the NavigationServer."
msgstr "可以不借助节点，直接在 NavigationServer 上新建障碍物。"

msgid ""
"Obstacles created with scripts require at least a ``map`` and a "
"``position``. For dynamic use a ``radius`` is required. For static use an "
"array of ``vertices`` is required."
msgstr ""
"使用脚本创建的障碍物至少需要有一个 ``map`` 和一个 ``position``\\ 。动态障碍物"
"还需要 ``radius``\\ 。静态障碍物还需要 ``vertices`` 属性。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
