msgid "Using NavigationRegions"
msgstr "使用 NavigationRegion"

msgid ""
"NavigationRegions are the visual Node representation of a **region** of the "
"navigation **map** on the NavigationServer. Each NavigationRegion node holds "
"a resource for the navigation mesh data."
msgstr ""
"NavigationRegion 即导航区块，是对 NavigationServer 的导航\\ **地图**\\ 中某个"
"\\ **区块**\\ 的可视化 Node 表示。每个 NavigationRegion 节点中都存放着导航网"
"格数据资源。"

msgid ""
"Both 2D and 3D version are available as :ref:"
"`NavigationRegion2D<class_NavigationRegion2D>` and :ref:"
"`NavigationRegion3D<class_NavigationRegion3D>` respectively."
msgstr ""
"2D 和 3D 版本分别为 :ref:`NavigationRegion2D<class_NavigationRegion2D>` 和 :"
"ref:`NavigationRegion3D<class_NavigationRegion3D>`\\ 。"

msgid ""
"Individual NavigationRegions upload their 2D NavigationPolygon or 3D "
"NavigationMesh resource data to the NavigationServer. The NavigationServer "
"map turns this information into a combined navigation map for pathfinding."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a navigation region using the scene tree add a "
"``NavigationRegion2D`` or ``NavigationRegion3D`` node to the scene. All "
"regions require a navigation mesh resource to function. See :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_using_navigationmeshes` to learn how to create and apply "
"navigation meshes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationRegions will automatically push ``global_transform`` changes to "
"the region on the NavigationServer which makes them suitable for moving "
"platforms. The NavigationServer will attempt to connect the navigation "
"meshes of individual regions when they are close enough. For more details "
"see :ref:`doc_navigation_connecting_navmesh`. To connect NavigationRegions "
"over arbitrary distances see :ref:`doc_navigation_using_navigationlinks` to "
"learn how to create and use ``NavigationLinks``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While changing the transform of a NavigationRegion node does update the "
"region position on the NavigationServer, changing the scale does not. A "
"navigation mesh resource has no scale and needs to be fully updated when "
"source geometry changes scale."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regions can be enabled / disabled and if disabled will not contribute to "
"future pathfinding queries."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Existing paths will not be automatically updated when a region gets "
"enabled / disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating new navigation regions"
msgstr "新建导航区块"

msgid ""
"New NavigationRegion nodes will automatically register to the default world "
"navigation map for their 2D/3D dimension."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The region RID can then be obtained from NavigationRegion Nodes with "
"``get_region_rid()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"New regions can also be created with the NavigationServer API and added to "
"any existing map."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If regions are created with the NavigationServer API directly they need to "
"be assigned a navigation map manually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationRegions can only be assigned to a single NavigationMap. If an "
"existing region is assigned to a new map it will leave the old map."
