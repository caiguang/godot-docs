msgid ""
"With all rendering methods, up to 8 DirectionalLights can be visible at a "

msgid ""
"**Blur:** Multiplies the shadow blur radius for this light. This works with "
"both traditional shadow mapping and contact-hardening shadows (lights with "
"**Angular Distance** or **Size** greater than ``0.0``). Higher values result "
"in softer shadows, which will also appear to be more temporally stable for "

"`doc_lights_and_shadows_shadow_filter_mode`."
msgstr ""
"**Blur：** （模糊）倍增此灯光的阴影模糊半径。它适用于传统阴影贴图和接触硬化阴"

msgid ""
"In general, increasing **Shadow Normal Bias** is preferred over increasing "
"**Shadow Bias**. Increasing **Shadow Normal Bias** does not cause as much "
"peter-panning as increasing **Shadow Bias**, but it can still resolve most "

"Bias** is that it can make shadows appear thinner for certain objects."
msgstr ""
"一般来说，增加 **Shadow Normal Bias** 比增加 **Shadow Bias** 更可取。增大 "
"**Shadow Normal Bias** 不会像增大 **Shadow Bias** 那样导致更多的阴影悬浮，但"

msgid ""
"Tweaking shadow mapping settings is an art – there are no \"one size fits "

"shadow bias values on a per-light basis."
msgstr ""
"调整阴影贴图设置是一门艺术，没有 \"放之四海而皆准\"的设置。为了获得最佳的视觉"
"效果，你可能需要针对每个灯光使用不同的阴影偏置值。"

msgid ""
"**Note on Appearance Changes**: When enabling shadows on a light, be aware "
"that the light's appearance might change compared to when it's rendered "
"without shadows in the compatibility renderer. Due to limitations with older "
"mobile devices, shadows are implemented using a multi-pass rendering "
"approach so lights with shadows are rendered in sRGB space instead of linear "
"space. This change in rendering space can sometimes drastically alter the "
"light's appearance. To achieve a similar appearance to an unshadowed light, "
"you may need to adjust the light's energy setting."

msgid ""
"To fix this, a technique named *Parallel Split Shadow Maps* (PSSM) is used. "
"This splits the view frustum in 2 or 4 areas. Each area gets its own shadow "
"map. This allows small areas close to the viewer to have the same shadow "
"resolution as a huge, far-away area. When shadows are enabled for "
"DirectionalLight3D, the default shadow mode is PSSM with 4 splits. In "
"scenarios where an object is large enough to appear in all four splits, it "
"results in increased draw calls. Specifically, such an object will be "
"rendered five times in total: once for each of the four shadow splits and "
"once for the final scene rendering. This can impact performance, "
"understanding this behavior is important for optimizing your scene and "

"Default values generally work well, but tweaking the first split a bit is "

msgstr ""
"每个分割距离都是相对于相机最远处进行控制的（如果大于 ``0`` ，则为阴影 **Max "

"便为近处对象提供更多细节（比如第三人称游戏中的角色）。"

msgid ""
"Always make sure to set a shadow **Max Distance** according to what the "
"scene needs. A lower maximum distance will result in better-looking shadows "
"and better performance, as fewer objects will need to be included in shadow "

"Distance** fully covers the scene at any given camera position, you can "
"increase **Fade Start** to ``1.0`` to prevent the shadow from fading at a "

msgstr ""
"请务必根据场景需要设置阴影的 **Max Distance** 。最大距离越小，阴影效果越好，"
