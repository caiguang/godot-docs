"如果使用兼容性后端，请考虑使用 Sprite3D 作为将贴花投影到（大部分）平坦表面的"
"替代方案。"

msgid ""
"Decals are projected textures that apply on opaque or transparent surfaces "
"in 3D. This projection happens in real-time and doesn't rely on mesh "
"generation. This allows you to move decals every frame with only a small "
"performance impact, even when applied on complex meshes."
msgstr ""
"贴花是应用于 3D 不透明或透明表面的投影纹理。 该投影是实时生成的，不依赖于网格"
"生成。 这允许你在每一帧移动贴花，即使在复杂的网格上应用时，也只会对性能产生很"
"小的影响。"

msgid ""
"While decals cannot add actual geometry detail onto the projected surface, "
"decals can still make use of physically-based rendering to provide similar "
"properties to full-blown :abbr:`PBR (Physically-Based Rendering)` materials."
msgstr ""
"虽然贴花无法将实际的几何细节添加到投影表面上，但贴花仍然可以利用基于物理的渲"

msgid "Static decoration"
msgstr "静态装饰"

msgid ""
"Sometimes, the fastest way to add texture detail to a scene is to use "
"decals. This is especially the case for organic detail, such as patches of "
"dirt or sand scattered on a large surface. Decals can help break up texture "
"repetition in scenes and make patterns look more natural. On a smaller "
"scale, decals can also be used to create detail variations for objects. For "
"example, decals can be used to add nuts and bolts on top of hard-surface "
"geometry."
msgstr ""
"有时，向场景添加纹理细节的最快方法是使用贴花。 对于有机细节（organic detail）"
"尤其如此，例如散布在大表面上的污垢或沙子。 贴花可以帮助打破场景中的纹理重复，"
"并使图案看起来更自然。 在较小的规模上，贴花也可用于创建对象的细节变化。 例"
"如，贴花可用于在硬表面几何体（hard-surface geometry）顶部添加螺母和螺栓。"

msgid ""
"Since decals can inject their own :abbr:`PBR (Physically-Based Rendering)` "
"properties on top of the projected surfaces, they can also be used to create "
"footprints or wet puddles."
msgstr ""
"由于贴花可以在投影表面上注入自己的 :abbr:`PBR (Physically-Based Rendering)` "
"属性，因此它们也可以用于创建足迹或湿水坑。"

msgid "Dirt added on top of level geometry using decals"
msgstr "使用贴花在关卡几何体（ level geometry ）顶部添加污垢"

msgid "Dynamic gameplay elements"
msgstr "动态游戏元素"

msgid ""
"Decals can represent temporary or persistent gameplay effects such as bullet "
"impacts and explosion scorches."
msgstr "贴花可以展现暂时或持久的游戏特效，例如子弹撞击和爆炸烧焦。"

msgid ""
"Using an AnimationPlayer node or a script, decals can be made to fade over "
"time (and then be removed using ``queue_free()``) to improve performance."
msgstr ""
"使用 AnimationPlayer 节点或脚本，可以使贴花随着时间的推移而褪色（然后使用 "
"``queue_free()`` 删除）以提高性能。"

msgid "Blob shadows"
msgstr "片面阴影"

msgid ""
"Blob shadows are frequently used in mobile projects (or to follow a retro "
"art style), as real-time lighting tends to be too expensive on low-end "
"mobile devices. However, when relying on baked lightmaps with fully baked "
"lights, dynamic objects will not cast *any* shadow from those lights. This "
"makes dynamic objects in lightmapped scenes look flat in comparison to real-"
"time lighting, with dynamic objects almost looking like they're floating."
msgstr ""
"斑点阴影经常用于移动项目（或遵循复古艺术风格），因为实时照明在低端移动设备上"
"往往耗费过大。 但是，当依赖具有完全烘焙灯光的烘焙光照贴图时，动态对象不会从这"
"些灯光投射 *任何* 阴影。 与实时光照相比，这使得光照贴图场景中的动态对象看起来"
"很平坦，动态对象几乎看起来像是漂浮的。"

msgid ""
"Thanks to blob shadows, dynamic objects can still cast an approximative "
"shadow. Not only this helps with depth perception in the scene, but this can "
"also be a gameplay element, especially in 3D platformers. The blob shadow's "
"length can be extended to let the player know where they will land if they "
"fall straight down."
msgstr ""
"由于斑点阴影，动态对象仍然可以投射近似阴影。 这不仅有助于场景中的深度感知，而"
"且还可以成为一种游戏元素，尤其是在 3D 平台游戏中。 斑点阴影的长度可以延长，让"
"玩家知道如果他们垂直落下时自己会落在哪里。"

msgid ""
"Even with real-time lighting, blob shadows can still be useful as a form of "
"ambient occlusion for situations where SSAO is too expensive or too unstable "
"due to its screen-space nature. For example, vehicles' underside shadows are "
"well-represented using blob shadows."
msgstr ""
"即使使用实时光照，斑点阴影仍然可以作为环境光遮挡的一种形式，适用于 SSAO 由于"
"其屏幕空间性质而消耗过大或过于不稳定的情况。 例如，使用斑点阴影很好地表现了车"

msgstr ""
"在检查器中，展开 **Textures** 部分并在 **Textures > Albedo** 中加载纹理。"

msgid ""
"Move the Decal node towards an object, then rotate it so the decal is "
"visible (and in the right orientation). If the decal appears mirrored, try "
"to rotate it by 180 degrees. You can double-check whether it's in the right "
"orientation by increasing **Parameters > Normal Fade** to 0.5. This will "
"prevent the Decal from being projected on surfaces that are not facing the "
"decal."
msgstr ""
"将贴花节点移向对象，然后旋转它以使贴花可见（并且方向正确）。 如果贴花看起来是"
"镜像的，请尝试将其旋转 180 度。 你可以通过将 **Parameters > Normal Fade** 增"
"加到 0.5 来仔细检查其方向是否正确。 这将防止贴花投影到不面向贴花的表面上。"

msgid ""
"If your decal is meant to affect static objects only, configure it to "
"prevent affecting dynamic objects (or vice versa). To do so, change the "
"decal's **Cull Mask** property to exclude certain layers. After doing this, "
"modify your dynamic objects' MeshInstance3D nodes to change their visibility "
"layers. For instance, you can move them from layer 1 to layer 2, then "
"disable layer 2 in the decal's **Cull Mask** property."
msgstr ""
"如果你的贴花仅影响静态对象，请将其配置为防止影响动态对象（反之亦然）。 为此，"
"请更改贴花的 **Cull Mask** （剔除蒙版）属性以排除某些图层。 执行此操作后，修"
"改动态对象的 MeshInstance3D 节点以更改其可见性层。 例如，你可以将它们从第 1 "
"层移动到第 2 层，然后在贴花的 **Cull Mask** 属性中禁用第 2 层。"

msgid "Decal node properties"
msgstr "贴花节点属性"

msgid ""
"**Extents:** The size of the decal. The Y axis determines the length of the "
"decal's projection. Keep the projection length as short as possible to "
"improve culling opportunities, therefore improving performance."
msgstr ""
"**Extents：** （范围）贴花的大小。 Y 轴决定贴花投影的长度。 保持投影长度尽可"
"能短，以增加剔除机会，从而提高性能。"

msgid "Textures"
msgstr "纹理"

msgid ""
"**Albedo:** The albedo (diffuse/color) map to use for the decal. In most "
"situations, this is the texture you want to set first. If using a normal or "
"ORM map, an albedo map *must* be set to provide an alpha channel. This alpha "
"channel will be used as a mask to determine how much the normal/ORM maps "
"will affect the underlying surface."
msgstr ""
"**Albedo：** （反照率）用于贴花的反照率（漫反射/颜色）贴图。 在大多数情况下，"
"这是你要首先设置的纹理。 如果使用法线或 ORM 贴图，则 *必须* 设置反照率贴图以"
"提供 Alpha 通道。 该 Alpha 通道将用作遮罩，以确定法线/ORM 贴图对底层表面的影"
"响程度。"

msgid ""
"**Normal:** The normal map to use for the decal. This can be used to "
"increase perceived detail on the decal by modifying how light reacts to it. "
"The impact of this texture is multiplied by the albedo texture's alpha "
"channel (but not **Albedo Mix**)."
msgstr ""
"**Normal：** （法线）用于贴花的法线贴图。 这可用于通过修改光对其的反应方式来"
"增加贴花上的感知细节。 该纹理的影响会乘以反照率纹理的 Alpha 通道（但不是 "
"**Albedo Mix** ）。"

msgid ""
"**ORM:** The Occlusion/Roughness/Metallic map to use for the decal. This is "
"an optimized format for storing PBR material maps. Ambient Occlusion map is "
"stored in the red channel, roughness map in the green channel, metallic map "
"in the blue channel. The impact of this texture is multiplied by the albedo "
"texture's alpha channel (but not **Albedo Mix**)."
msgstr ""
"**ORM：** 用于贴花的遮挡（Occlusion）/粗糙度（Roughness）/金属贴图（Metallic "
"map）。 这是用于存储 PBR 材质贴图的优化格式。 环境光遮挡贴图存储在红色通道"
"中，粗糙度贴图存储在绿色通道中，金属贴图存储在蓝色通道中。 该纹理的影响会乘以"
"反照率纹理的 Alpha 通道（但不是 **Albedo Mix** ）。"

msgid ""
"**Emission:** The emission texture to use for the decal. Unlike **Albedo**, "

msgstr "参数"

msgid "**Emission Energy:** The brightness of the emission texture."
msgstr "**Emission Energy：** （自发光能量）自发光纹理的亮度。"

msgid ""
"**Modulate:** Multiplies the color of the albedo and emission textures. Use "
"this to tint decals (e.g. for paint decals, or to increase variation by "
"randomizing each decal's modulation)."
msgstr ""
"**Modulate：** （调制）将反射率和自发光贴图的颜色相乘。通过这种方式对贴花进行"
"着色（例如，对于绘画贴花）或通过随机化每个贴花的调制来增加多样性。"

msgid ""
"**Albedo Mix:** The opacity of the albedo texture. Unlike using an albedo "
"texture with a more transparent alpha channel, decreasing this value below "
"``1.0`` does *not* reduce the impact of the normal/ORM texture on the "
"underlying surface. Set this to ``0.0`` when creating normal/ORM-only decals "
"such as footsteps or wet puddles."
msgstr ""
"**Albedo Mix：** （反照率混合）反照率纹理的不透明度。与使用具有更透明 alpha "
"通道的反照率纹理不同，将该值降低到 ``1.0`` 以下 *不会* 减少法线/ORM 纹理对下"
"表面的影响。在创建仅普通/ORM 贴花（如足迹或湿水坑）时，将此值设置为 "
"``0.0`` 。"

msgid ""
"**Normal Fade:** Fades the Decal if the angle between the Decal's :abbr:"
"`AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)` and the target surface becomes too large. "
"A value of ``0.0`` projects the decal regardless of angle, while a value of "
"``0.999`` limits the decal to surfaces that are nearly perpendicular. "
"Setting **Normal Fade** to a value greater than ``0.0`` has a small "
"performance cost due to the added normal angle computations."
msgstr ""
"**Normal Fade：** （法线衰减）当贴花的 :abbr:`AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding "
"Box, 轴对齐边界框)`与目标表面之间的角度变得过大时，贴花将会淡出。值为 "
"``0.0`` 时，不管角度如何都会投影出贴花，而值为 ``0.999`` 时，贴花将仅限于几乎"
"垂直的表面。由于额外的法线角度计算，将 **Normal Fade** 设置为大于 ``0.0`` 的"

msgid "Vertical Fade"
msgstr "垂直淡化（Vertical Fade）"

msgid ""
"**Upper Fade:** The curve over which the decal will fade as the surface gets "

"(towards the decal's projection angle). Only positive values are valid."
msgstr ""
"**Upper Fade：** （上部淡化）随着表面远离 :abbr:`AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding "
"Box 轴对齐边界框)`中心（朝向贴花的投影角），贴花将逐渐淡出的曲线。 只有正值才"

msgid "Distance Fade"
msgstr "距离淡出"

msgid ""
"**Enabled:** Controls whether distance fade (a form of :abbr:`LOD (Level of "
"Detail)`) is enabled. The decal will fade out over **Begin + Length**, after "
"which it will be culled and not sent to the shader at all. Use this to "
"reduce the number of active decals in a scene and thus improve performance."
msgstr ""
"**Enabled（启用）：**\\ 控制是否启用距离淡出（\\ :abbr:`LOD (Level of "
"Detail)` 的一种形式）。 贴花将在 **Begin + Length** 内淡出，之后它将被剔除并"

msgid ""
"**Begin:** The distance from the camera at which the decal begins to fade "
"away (in 3D units)."
msgstr "**Begin：** （开始）贴花开始淡出时距相机的距离（以 3D 单位表示）。"

msgid ""
"**Length:** The distance over which the decal fades (in 3D units). The decal "
"becomes slowly more transparent over this distance and is completely "
"invisible at the end. Higher values result in a smoother fade-out "
"transition, which is more suited when the camera moves fast."
msgstr ""
"**Length：** （长度）贴花淡出的距离（以 3D 单位表示）。 贴花在这段距离内逐渐"
"变得透明，最后完全不可见。 值越高，淡出过渡越平滑，这在相机快速移动时更适合。"

msgid "Cull Mask"
msgstr "Cull Mask（剔除遮罩）"

msgid ""
"**Cull Mask:** Specifies which VisualInstance3D layers this decal will "
"project on. By default, decals affect all layers. This is used so you can "
"specify which types of objects receive the decal and which do not. This is "
"especially useful so you can ensure that dynamic objects don't accidentally "
"receive a Decal intended for the terrain under them."
msgstr ""
"**Cull Mask：** （剔除遮罩）指定此贴花将投影到哪些 VisualInstance3D 图层。 默"
"认情况下，贴花会影响所有图层。 使用它可以指定哪些类型的对象接收贴花，哪些类型"
"不接收贴花。 这个功能特别有用，你可以确保动态对象不会意外收到针对其下方地形的"
"贴花。"

msgid "Tweaking performance and quality"
msgstr "调整性能和质量"

msgid ""
"Decal rendering performance is mostly determined by their screen coverage, "
"but also their number. In general, a few large decals that cover up most of "
"the screen will be more expensive to render than many small decals that are "
"scattered around."
msgstr ""
"贴花渲染性能主要取决于其屏幕覆盖范围及其数量。 一般来说，覆盖大部分屏幕的一些"
"大贴花的渲染消耗，会比散布在各处的许多小贴花的渲染消耗更高。"

msgid ""
"To improve rendering performance, you can enable the **Distance Fade** "
"property as described above. This will make distant decals fade out when "
"they are far away from the camera (and may have little to no impact on the "
"final scene rendering). Using node groups, you can also prevent non-"
"essential decorative decals from spawning based on user configuration."
msgstr ""
"要提高渲染性能，你可以如上所述启用 **Distance Fade** 属性。 这将使远处的贴花"
"在远离相机时淡出（并且可能对最终场景渲染几乎没有影响）。 使用节点组，你还可以"
"根据用户配置防止生成非必要的装饰贴花。"

msgid ""
"The way decals are rendered also has an impact on performance. The "
"**Rendering > Textures > Decals > Filter** advanced project setting lets you "
"control how decal textures should be filtered. **Nearest/Linear** does not "
"use mipmaps. However, decals will look grainy at a distance. **Nearest/"
"Linear Mipmaps** will look smoother at a distance, but decals will look "
"blurry when viewed from oblique angles. This can be resolved by using "
"**Nearest/Linear Mipmaps Anisotropic**, which provides the highest quality "
"but is also slower to render."
msgstr ""
"贴花的渲染方式也会对性能产生影响。 **渲染 > 纹理 > 贴花 > 过滤** 高级项目设置"
"可让你控制如何过滤贴花纹理。 **Nearest/Linear** 不使用 mipmap。 然而，贴花在"
"远处看起来会有颗粒感。 **Nearest/Linear Mipmaps** 在远处看起来会更平滑，但从"
"倾斜角度观看时贴花会看起来模糊。 这可以通过使用 **Nearest/Linear Mipmaps "
"Anisotropic** 来解决，它提供最高的质量，但渲染速度也较慢。"

msgid ""
"If your project has a pixel art style, consider setting the filter to one of "
"the **Nearest** values so that decals use nearest-neighbor filtering. "
"Otherwise, stick to **Linear**."
msgstr ""
"如果你的项目具有像素艺术风格，请考虑将过滤设置为 **Nearest** 值之一（即具有 "

msgid "Limitations"
msgstr "限制"

msgid ""
"Decals cannot affect material properties other than the ones listed above, "
"such as height (for parallax mapping)."
msgstr ""
"贴图不能影响除上面列出的材质特性之外的材质特性，例如高度（用于视差贴图）。"

msgid ""
"For performance reasons, decals use purely fixed rendering logic. This means "
"decals cannot use custom shaders. However, custom shaders on the projected "
"surfaces are able to read the information that is overridden by decals on "
"top of them, such as roughness and metallic."
msgstr ""
"出于性能方面的考虑，贴花使用的是完全固定的渲染逻辑，也就是说贴花无法使用自定"

msgid ""
"When using the Forward+ renderer, Godot uses a *clustering* approach for "
"decal rendering. As many decals as desired can be added (as long as "
"performance allows). However, there's still a default limit of 512 "
"*clustered elements* that can be present in the current camera view. A "
"clustered element is an omni light, a spot light, a :ref:`decal "
