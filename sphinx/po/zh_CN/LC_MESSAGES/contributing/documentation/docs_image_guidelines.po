msgid "Creating documentation images"
msgstr "创建文档图像"

msgid ""
"Throughout documentation images are often needed to make the explanation of "
"a feature or concept as clear as possible for a reader. This page will "
"explain the process from beginning to end."
msgstr ""
"在整个文档中，通常需要图像来使读者尽可能清楚地解释功能或概念。本页将从头到尾"
"解释该过程。"

msgid "Capturing an image"
msgstr "截图"

msgid ""
"To take a picture of something in Godot a screen capture tool can be used."
msgstr "可以使用屏幕截图工具截取 Godot 中的内容。"

msgid ""
"On Windows 10 and 11 that would be the Snip & Sketch program. Pressing :kbd:"
"`Windows + Shift + S` lets you take a screenshot of a portion of the screen "
"and save it to the clipboard. After pressing those keys, click and drag over "
"the area you wish to take a picture of."
msgstr ""
"在 Windows 10 和 11 上，这将是 Snip & Sketch 程序。按 :kbd:`Windows + Shift "
"+ S` 可以截取屏幕一部分的屏幕截图并将其保存到剪贴板。按下这些键后，点击并拖动"
"你想要截取的区域。"

msgid ""
"On macOS, pressing :kbd:`Shift + Command + 3` does the same. To take a "
"picture of the entire screen press :kbd:`Shift + Command + 4`. All "
"screenshots taken will be saved to the desktop."
msgstr ""
"在 macOS 上，按 :kbd:`Shift + Command + 3` 有相同的效果。要拍摄整个屏幕的照"
"片，请按 :kbd:`Shift + Command + 4`。所有截取的屏幕截图都将保存到桌面。"

msgid ""
"Each Linux desktop environment has it's own screenshot tool. For example, on "
"KDE Plasma the program Spectacle is used for taking screenshots. If your "
"distribution doesn't come with one by default try searching its package "
"repository, or Flathub if that's supported."
msgstr ""
"每种Linux桌面环境都有自己的屏幕截图工具。比如，在KDE Plasma（译者注：一种"
"linux桌面环境）中，Spectacle 程序用于拍摄截图。如果你的发行版默认没有截图工"
"具，尝试搜索包存储库。如果支持也可以搜索Flathub（译者注：一种Linux应用商"
"店）。"

msgid ""
"All screenshots should ideally be taken on a 1080p screen. Anything higher "
"resolution is adding detail that doesn't make the documentation better and "
"dramatically increases file size. If you're taking screenshots on a higher "
"resolution screen the screenshot should be scaled down. There are "
"instructions on how to do this later on this page."
msgstr ""
"所有的屏幕截图最好在1080p分辨率屏幕上截取。使用更高分辨率会增加无谓细节，这不"
"但不能使文件更好，而且会显著增加文件大小。如果你在更高分辨率的屏幕上截图，截"
"图应该缩小。在本页的后面，会有关于如何执行此操作的说明。"

msgid "Format conversion"
msgstr "格式转换"

msgid ""
"The current format for images in Godot's documentation is WebP (``.webp``). "
"While some Linux programs will support saving screenshots in this format, "
"macOS and the Snip & Sketch program on Windows do not. For images that don't "
"need editing, such as precise cropping or adding outlines, Squoosh can be "
"used. `Squoosh <https://squoosh.app/>`_ is a converter developed by Google, "
"is open source, and doesn't give Google any image rights by using it. When "
"choosing compression if you can get an image that's under 300KB in size use "
"lossless compression. If it's over 300KB use just enough lossy compression "
"to get it under that size. If this results in noticable compression "
"artifacts using less compression is fine, even if the file size is bigger."
msgstr ""
"Godot 文档中当前的图像格式是 WebP (``.webp``)。虽然某些 Linux 程序支持以这种"
"格式保存屏幕截图，但 macOS 和 Windows 上的 Snip & Sketch 程序不支持。对于不需"
"要编辑的图像，例如精确裁剪或添加轮廓，可以使用 Squoosh。 `Squoosh <https://"
"squoosh.app/>`_ 是由 Google 开发的开源图片转换器，并且不会通过使用它而向 "
"Google 授予任何图像权利。选择压缩时，如果你的图片大小低于 300KB，请使用无损压"
"缩。如果大小超过 300KB，请使用强度足够大的有损压缩来使其低于该大小。如果使用"
"较强的有损压缩会导致明显的压缩伪影，则降低压缩的强度，即使文件大小较大。"

msgid ""
"If you already have an image editor such as GIMP, Krita or Photoshop "
"installed it may have the ability to open an image then save it as a WebP "
"file."
msgstr ""
"如果你已经安装了图像编辑器，比如GIMP，Krita或者Photoshop，这些软件可以打开图"
"像，然后将其保存为一个WebP（译者注：一种图像文件格式）文件。"

msgid "Cropping"
msgstr "裁剪"

msgid ""
"For a screenshot of a 2D or 3D scene in the editor the above steps will be "
"enough. But for most UI images some extra work should be done, specifically "
"cropping to make an image look clean. Below is an example of good cropping."
msgstr ""
"对于编辑器中的2D或3D场景的屏幕截图，上述步骤就足够了。但是对于大多数UI图像，"
"需要做一些额外工作，特别是进行裁剪让图像看起来干净些。下面的是一个不错的裁剪"
"操作例子。"

msgid ""
"For cropping Krita is the recommended program. While some screenshot "
"programs do have cropping built in it's not always easy to get something "
"precise. And while Krita is designed as a painting program the cropping tool "
"gives you pixel precision by default. Of course, feel free to use a "
"different program you are familiar with."
msgstr ""
"对于图片裁剪这里推荐 Krita。虽然某些屏幕截图程序确实内置了裁剪功能，但获得精"
"确的结果并不那么容易。虽然 Krita 被设计为绘画程序，但其裁剪工具默认提供像素精"
"度。当然，你也可以随意使用你熟悉的其他程序。"

msgid ""
"If you've never used Krita before download it from the `official Krita "
"website <https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/>`_, on Linux you may "
"also be able to download it from your distributions repository, flathub is "
"also an option. Once it's installed on your computer open Krita then open "
"the image you want to crop. This button on the left panel is the crop tool."
msgstr ""
"如果你之前从未使用过 Krita，请从`Krita 官方网站 <https://krita.org/en/"
"download/krita-desktop/>`_ 下载它，在 Linux 上也可以从你的发行版下载它的存储"
"库，flathub 也是一个选项。将其安装到计算机上后，打开 Krita，然后打开要裁剪的"
"图像。左侧面板上的这个按钮是裁剪工具。"

msgid ""
"After selecting it, click on the image, you should now have cropping tools "
"available."
msgstr "选择它后，单击图像，现在应该可以使用裁剪工具。"

msgid ""
"Click and drag the white boxes to adjust what gets cropped, if you zoom in "
"close to the image you will see the individual pixels in an image, which is "
"useful for precision."
msgstr ""
"点击并拖动白色框以调整裁剪的内容，如果放大图像，你将看到图像中的各个像素，这"
"对精度很有用。"

msgid ""
"If you make a mistake and overcrop don't worry, cropping is non-destructive "
"in Krita and can be adjusted. Click on the image with your cropping tool "
"still selected and the controls will return."
msgstr ""
"如果你编辑失误并且进行了过度裁剪，请不要担心，Krita 中的裁剪是非破坏性的，并"
"且可以进行调整。在仍选择裁剪工具的情况下单击图像，控件将返回。"

msgid "Scaling down an image"
msgstr "缩小图像"

msgid ""
"As explained earlier on this page, all images taken on a screen that is a "
"higher resolution than 1080p should be scaled down. To do this in Krita "
"click on **Image** on the top bar, and from the dropdown menu select **Scale "
"Image To New Size**. This menu can also be opened by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl + "
"Alt + I`. On this menu you want to adjust the pixel dimensions. For anything "
"taken on a 4K monitor change the value of the width and height to half of "
"its current value, for anything taken on a 1440p monitor multiply the width "
"and height by 0.75. Make sure the **Constrain Proportions** box at the "
"bottom of the menu is checked so you only have to change 1 value."
msgstr ""
"正如本页前面所解释的，在分辨率高于 1080p 的屏幕上拍摄的所有图像都应按比例缩"
"小。要在 Krita 中执行此操作，请单击顶部栏上的 **图像** ，然后从下拉菜单中选"
"择 **将图像缩放到新尺寸** 。也可以通过按 :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt + I` 打开此菜单。在"
"此菜单上调整像素尺寸。对于在 4K 显示器上拍摄的任何内容，请将宽度和高度的值更"
"改为其当前值的一半；对于在 1440p 显示器上拍摄的任何内容，请将宽度和高度乘以 "
"0.75。确保选中菜单底部的 **约束比例** 框，这样只需更改 1 个值。"

msgid "Saving as WebP in Krita"
msgstr "在 Krita 中保存为 WebP"

msgid ""
"To save an image as webp if it isn't already one, Go to **File > Save As**. "
"Select **webp** from the **Save as type:** dropdown, then choose wherever "
"you want to save it. After clicking **Save** a menu will popup with webp "
"options. Make sure **Losses** is checked and **Quality** is set to 100%. "
"This means the image will not lose detail and will be as small as possible."
msgstr ""
"要将图像另存为 webp（如果还不是），请转至 **文件 > 另存为** 。从 **保存类型："
"** 下拉列表中选择 **webp** ，然后选择要保存的位置。单击 **保存** 后，将弹出一"
"个带有 webp 选项的菜单。确保选中 **Losses** 并将 **Quality** 设置为 100%。这"
"意味着图像不会丢失细节并且会尽可能的小。"

msgid ""
"If the image is over 300KB in size try compressing it losslessly using "
"`Squoosh <https://squoosh.app/>`_. If it's still over 300KB change to lossy "
"compression and slowly increase the compression until it's under 300KB. If "
"this results in noticable compression artifacts using less compression is "
"fine, even if the file size is bigger."
msgstr ""
"如果图像大小超过 300KB，请尝试使用 `Squoosh <https://squoosh.app/>`_ 无损压"
"缩。如果它仍然超过 300KB，则更改为有损压缩，并缓慢增加压缩，直到它低于 "
"300KB。如果这导致使用较少的压缩产生明显的压缩伪影，那么即使文件大小更大，也没"
"有关系。"

msgid "Outlines arrows and text"
msgstr "为箭头和文本添加轮廓"

msgid ""
"Sometimes an image needs something extra to properly direct the readers "
"attention, or make something clear. Outlines and arrows can be used for this "
"purpose. For these types of edits Inkscape is the recommended open source "
"program, it can be downloaded from the `official Inkscape website <https://"
"inkscape.org/>`_. Like Krita, if you're on Linux you can also check your "
"distributions repository or get it from Flathub."
msgstr ""
"有时，一张图片需要一些额外的东西来适当的引导读者的注意力，或者让一些东西变得"
"清晰。轮廓线和箭头可以用于此目的。对于这些类型的编辑，Inkscape 是推荐的开源程"
"序，可以从`Inkscap 官方网站<https://inkscape.org/>`_ 下载 。像 Krita 一样，如"
"果你在 Linux 上，你也可以检查你的发行版仓库或从 Flatchub 获取。"

msgid ""
"A full tutorial on creating outlines is not provided here, we recommend "
"searching for various tutorials on how to use it online. However there are "
"two standards for doc image outlines and arrows. First, the color should be "
"yellow, specifically this hex color: ``fffb44`` (``fffb44ff`` if there is a "
"transparency value like in Inkscape). This color was chosen specifically to "
"make sure color blind people do not have issues reading the documentation, "
"other colors can be used in addition to this yellow if multiple outlines on "
"an image are needed, red should be avoided. The second standard is that all "
"outlines and arrow lines should be 2 pixels wide."
msgstr ""
"这里没有提供关于创建轮廓的完整教程，我们建议搜索各种关于如何在线使用它的教"
"程。但是，文档图像轮廓和箭头有两个标准。首先，颜色应该是黄色，特别是这种十六"
"进制颜色： ``fffb44`` （如果有像 Inkscape 中那样的透明度值，则为 "
"``fffb44ff`` ）。选择这种颜色是为了确保色盲在阅读文档时不会遇到问题，如果需要"
"在图像上使用多个轮廓，则除了这种黄色之外，还可以使用其他颜色，应避免使用红"
"色。第二个标准是所有的轮廓和箭头线都应该是 2 像素宽。"

msgid ""
"Finally, some images might require text to differentiate multiple parts of "
"an image. There are no strict requirements other than use an easy to read "
"non fancy font. As for color the yellow color from before should also be "
"used, but black or other colors can be used if appropriate. For example, if "
"yellow blends into the image, or if there are multiple outlines in multiple "
"colors."
msgstr ""
"最后，一些图像可能需要文本来区分图像的多个部分。除了使用易读的非花哨字体外，"
"没有其他严格的要求。至于颜色，也应该使用以前的黄色，但如果合适，可以使用黑色"
"或其他颜色。例如，如果黄色混合到图像中，或者如果存在多种颜色的多个轮廓。"

msgid "Adding an image to a documentation page"
msgstr "将图像添加到文档页面"

msgid ""
"Once you've finished working on your image, it can be added to the "
"documentation. All images are stored in folders named ``img`` next to the "
"page they are used in."
msgstr ""
"完成图像处理后，就可以将它添加到文档中了。所有的图像都保存在使用它们的页面旁"
"边的名为 ``img`` 的文件夹中。"

msgid ""
"To add your image, add it to the ``img`` folder that's in the same folder as "
"the ``.rst`` file for the page (create it if it doesn't exist). In the ``."
"rst`` page, images should be included with the following code snippet::"
msgstr ""
"要添加图像，请将其添加到 ``img`` 文件夹中，该文件夹与页面的 ``.rst`` 文件位于"
"同一文件夹中（如果不存在，请创建它）。在 ``.rst`` 页面中，图像应包含在以下代"
"码段中 ::"

msgid ""
"Where ``documentation_image.webp`` would be changed to the name of the image "
"you created. Name your images in a way that makes their meaning clear, "
"possibly with a prefix that makes their relationship to a documentation page "
"explicit."
msgstr ""
"其中 ``documentation_image.webp`` 将更改为所创建图像的名称。以明确的方式为图"
"像命名，可以的话使用前缀明确表示它们与文档页面的关系。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
