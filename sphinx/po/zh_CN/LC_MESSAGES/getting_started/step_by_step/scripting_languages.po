"This lesson will give you an overview of the available scripting languages "
"in Godot. You will learn the pros and cons of each option. In the next part, "
"you will write your first script using GDScript."
msgstr ""
"本课将向你介绍 Godot 中可用的脚本语言。你将了解每个选项的优点和缺点。在下一部"
"分，你将使用 GDScript 编写你的第一个脚本。"

"**Scripts attach to a node and extend its behavior**. This means that "
"scripts inherit all functions and properties of the node they attach to."
msgstr ""
"**脚本附加到节点并扩展其行为**\\ 。这意味着脚本继承所附加节点的全部函数和属"

"For example, take a game where a Camera2D node follows a ship. The Camera2D "
"node follows its parent by default. Imagine you want the camera to shake "
"when the player takes damage. As this feature is not built into Godot, you "
"would attach a script to the Camera2D node and code the shake."
msgstr ""
"例如，以一个 Camera2D 节点跟随一艘船的游戏为例。Camera2D 节点默认跟随其父节"
"点。想象一下，当玩家受到伤害时，你希望相机震动。由于此功能未内置在 Godot 中，"
"因此你可以在该 Camera2D 节点上附加脚本并对抖动进行编程。"

"Godot offers **four gameplay programming languages**: GDScript, C#, and, via "
"its GDExtension technology, C and C++. There are more community-supported "
"languages, but these are the official ones."
msgstr ""
"Godot 提供了\\ **四种游戏编程语言**\\ ：GDScript、C# 以及通过 GDExtension 技"

"You can use multiple languages in a single project. For instance, in a team, "
"you could code gameplay logic in GDScript as it's fast to write, and use C# "
"or C++ to implement complex algorithms and maximize their performance. Or "
"you can write everything in GDScript or C#. It's your call."
msgstr ""
"你可以在一个项目中使用多种语言。例如，在团队中，你可以在 GDScript 中编写游戏"
"逻辑，因为它编写起来很快，并使用 C# 或 C++ 来实现复杂的算法并最大限度地提高其"

msgid "Which language should I use?"
msgstr "我应该使用哪种语言？"

msgid ""
"If you're a beginner, we recommend to **start with GDScript**. We made this "
"language specifically for Godot and the needs of game developers. It has a "
"lightweight and straightforward syntax and provides the tightest integration "
"with Godot."
msgstr ""
"如果你是初学者，我们推荐\\ **从 GDScript 入手**\\ 。这门语言是我们针对 Godot "
"和游戏开发者的需求制作的。语法简单直白，与 Godot 结合得最为紧密。"

msgid ""
"For C#, you will need an external code editor like `VSCode <https://code."
"visualstudio.com/>`_ or Visual Studio. While C# support is now mature, you "
"will find fewer learning resources for it compared to GDScript. That's why "
"we recommend C# mainly to users who already have experience with the "
"language."
msgstr ""
"使用 C# 时，你需要使用 `VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ 或 Visual "
"Studio 等外部编辑器。虽然对 C# 支持目前已经成熟，但相对 GDScript 而言，能找到"

"GDScript looks like Python as you structure your code blocks using "

"GDScript code itself doesn't execute as fast as compiled C# or C++. However, "
