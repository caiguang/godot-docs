"This lesson will give you an overview of the available scripting languages "
"in Godot. You will learn the pros and cons of each option. In the next part, "
"you will write your first script using GDScript."

"**Scripts attach to a node and extend its behavior**. This means that "
"scripts inherit all functions and properties of the node they attach to."

"For example, take a game where a Camera2D node follows a ship. The Camera2D "
"node follows its parent by default. Imagine you want the camera to shake "
"when the player takes damage. As this feature is not built into Godot, you "
"would attach a script to the Camera2D node and code the shake."

"Godot offers **four gameplay programming languages**: GDScript, C#, and, via "

"languages, but these are the official ones."

msgid ""
"You can use multiple languages in a single project. For instance, in a team, "
"you could code gameplay logic in GDScript as it's fast to write, and use C# "
"or C++ to implement complex algorithms and maximize their performance. Or "
"you can write everything in GDScript or C#. It's your call."

msgid ""
"If you're a beginner, we recommend to **start with GDScript**. We made this "
"language specifically for Godot and the needs of game developers. It has a "
"lightweight and straightforward syntax and provides the tightest integration "
"with Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For C#, you will need an external code editor like `VSCode <https://code."
"visualstudio.com/>`_ or Visual Studio. While C# support is now mature, you "
"will find fewer learning resources for it compared to GDScript. That's why "
"we recommend C# mainly to users who already have experience with the "
"language."

"No `garbage collection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"

"`Gradual typing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing>`_. Variables "

"GDScript looks like Python as you structure your code blocks using "
"indentations, but it doesn't work the same way in practice. It's inspired by "
"multiple languages, including Squirrel, Lua, and Python."

msgid "Why don't we use Python or Lua directly?"

"Years ago, Godot used Python, then Lua. Both languages' integration took a "
"lot of work and had severe limitations. For example, threading support was a "
"big challenge with Python."

"Developing a dedicated language doesn't take us more work and we can tailor "

"As Microsoft's `C# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"

"Jako że C# Microsoftu jest faworytem wśród twórców gier, dodaliśmy oficjalne "

"Since Godot uses .NET 6, in theory, you can use any third-party .NET library "

"GDScript code itself doesn't execute as fast as compiled C# or C++. However, "
"most script code calls functions written with fast algorithms in C++ code "
