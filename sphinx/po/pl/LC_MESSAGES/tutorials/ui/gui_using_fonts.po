"There are 2 kinds of font files: *dynamic* (TTF/OTF/WOFF/WOFF2 formats) and "

"higher sizes. Thanks to their vector-based nature, they can also contain a "
"lot more glyphs while keeping a reasonable file size compared to bitmap "
"fonts. Dynamic fonts also support some advanced features that bitmap fonts "
