"In a normal scenario, you would use a :ref:`MeshInstance3D "
"<class_MeshInstance3D>` node to display a 3D mesh like a human model for the "
"main character, but in some cases, you would like to create multiple "
"instances of the same mesh in a scene. You *could* duplicate the same node "
"multiple times and adjust the transforms manually. This may be a tedious "
"process and the result may look mechanical. Also, this method is not "
"conducive to rapid iterations. :ref:`MultiMeshInstance3D "
"<class_MultiMeshInstance3D>` is one of the possible solutions to this "
"problem."

msgid ""
"MultiMeshInstance3D, as the name suggests, creates multiple copies of a "
"MeshInstance over a surface of a specific mesh. An example would be having a "
"tree mesh populate a landscape mesh with trees of random scales and "
"orientations."

msgid "Setting up the nodes"

msgid ""
"The basic setup requires three nodes: the MultiMeshInstance3D node and two "
"MeshInstance3D nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One node is used as the target, the surface mesh that you want to place "
"multiple meshes on. In the tree example, this would be the landscape."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The other node is used as the source, the mesh that you want to have "
"duplicated. In the tree case, this would be the tree itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our example, we would use a :ref:`Node3D <class_Node3D>` node as the root "
"node of the scene. Your scene tree would look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "For simplicity's sake, this tutorial uses built-in primitives."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you have everything ready. Select the MultiMeshInstance3D node and look "
"at the toolbar, you should see an extra button called ``MultiMesh`` next to "
"``View``. Click it and select *Populate surface* in the dropdown menu. A new "
"window titled *Populate MultiMesh* will pop up."

"Select the target surface. In the tree case, this should be the landscape "
"node. The source mesh should be the tree node. Adjust the other parameters "
"according to your preference. Press ``Populate`` and multiple copies of the "
"source mesh will be placed over the target mesh. If you are satisfied with "
"the result, you can delete the mesh instance used as the source mesh."
