"The :ref:`ImmediateMesh <class_ImmediateMesh>` is a convenient tool to "
"create dynamic geometry using an OpenGL 1.x-style API. Which makes it both "
"approachable to use and efficient for meshes which need to be updated every "
"frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generating complex geometry (several thousand vertices) with this tool is "
"inefficient, even if it's done only once. Instead, it is designed to "
"generate simple geometry that changes every frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, you need to create a :ref:`MeshInstance3D <class_meshinstance3d>` and "
"add an :ref:`ImmediateMesh <class_ImmediateMesh>` to it in the Inspector."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, add a script to the MeshInstance3D. The code for the ImmediateMesh "
"should go in the ``_process()`` function if you want it to update each "
"frame, or in the ``_ready()`` function if you want to create the mesh once "
"and not update it. If you only generate a surface once, the ImmediateMesh is "
"just as efficient as any other kind of mesh as the generated mesh is cached "
"and reused."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To begin generating geometry you must call ``surface_begin()``. "
"``surface_begin()`` takes a ``PrimitiveType`` as an argument. "
"``PrimitiveType`` instructs the GPU how to arrange the primitive based on "
"the vertices given whether it is triangles, lines, points, etc. A complete "
"list can be found under the :ref:`Mesh <class_mesh>` class reference page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you have called ``surface_begin()`` you are ready to start adding "
"vertices. You add vertices one at a time. First you add vertex specific "
"attributes such as normals or UVs using ``surface_set_****()`` (e.g. "
"``surface_set_normal()``). Then you call ``surface_add_vertex()`` to add a "
"vertex with those attributes. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only attributes added before the call to ``surface_add_vertex()`` will be "
"included in that vertex. If you add an attribute twice before calling "
"``surface_add_vertex()``, only the second call will be used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, once you have added all your vertices call ``surface_end()`` to "
"signal that you have finished generating the surface. You can call "
"``surface_begin()`` and ``surface_end()`` multiple times to generate "
"multiple surfaces for the mesh."

msgid ""
"The example code below draws a single triangle in the ``_ready()`` function."
msgstr "Oto prosty przykład jak to działa."

msgid ""
"The ImmediateMesh can also be used across frames. Each time you call "
"``surface_begin()`` and ``surface_end()``, you are adding a new surface to "
"the ImmediateMesh. If you want to recreate the mesh from scratch each frame, "
"call ``surface_clear()`` before calling ``surface_begin()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above code will dynamically create and draw a single surface each frame."
