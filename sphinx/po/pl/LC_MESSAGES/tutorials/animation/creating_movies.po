"Godot can record **non-real-time** video and audio from any 2D or 3D "
"project. This kind of recording is also called *offline rendering*. There "
"are many scenarios where this is useful:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Recording game trailers for promotional use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Recording cutscenes that will be :ref:`displayed as pre-recorded videos "
"<doc_playing_videos>` in the final game. This allows for using higher "
"quality settings (at the cost of file size), regardless of the player's "
"hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Recording procedurally generated animations or motion design. User "
"interaction remains possible during video recording, and audio can be "
"included as well (although you won't be able to hear it while the video is "

"Comparing the visual output of graphics settings, shaders, or rendering "
"techniques in an animated scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With Godot's animation features such as the AnimationPlayer node, Tweeners, "
"particles and shaders, it can effectively be used to create any kind of 2D "
"and 3D animations (and still images)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are already used to Godot's workflow, you may find yourself more "
"productive by using Godot for video rendering compared to Blender. That "
"said, renderers designed for non-real-time usage such as Cycles and Eevee "
"can result in better visuals (at the cost of longer rendering times)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compared to real-time video recording, some advantages of non-real-time "
"recording include:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use any graphics settings (including extremely demanding settings) "
"regardless of your hardware's capabilities. The output video will *always* "
"have perfect frame pacing; it will never exhibit dropped frames or "
"stuttering. Faster hardware will allow you to render a given animation in "
"less time, but the visual output remains identical."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Render at a higher resolution than the screen resolution, without having to "
"rely on driver-specific tools such as NVIDIA's Dynamic Super Resolution or "
"AMD's Virtual Super Resolution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Render at a higher framerate than the video's target framerate, then :ref:"
"`post-process to generate high-quality motion blur "
"<doc_creating_movies_motion_blur>`. This also makes effects that converge "
"over several frames (such as temporal antialiasing, SDFGI and volumetric "
"fog) look better."

"**This feature is not designed for capturing real-time footage during "
"gameplay.**"

msgid ""
"Players should use something like `OBS Studio <https://obsproject.com/>`__ "
"or `SimpleScreenRecorder <https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/"

"the compositor than Godot can do using Vulkan or OpenGL natively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That said, if your game runs at near-real-time speeds when capturing, you "
"can still use this feature (but it will lack audible sound playback, as "

"**MJPEG Quality:** The JPEG quality to use when writing a video to an AVI "

"Pressing :kbd:`F8` (:kbd:`Cmd + .` on macOS) or pressing :kbd:`Ctrl + C` on "

"If you're using an AnimationPlayer to control a \"main action\" in the scene "

"The ``movie`` :ref:`feature tag <doc_feature_tags>` can be used to override "
"specific project settings. This is useful to enable high-quality graphics "
"settings that wouldn't be fast enough to run in real-time speeds on your "
"hardware. Remember that putting every setting to its maximum value can still "
"slow down movie saving speed, especially when recording at higher "
"resolutions. Therefore, it's still recommended to only increase graphics "
"settings if they make a meaningful difference in the output image."

"high resolutions such as 4K or 8K."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 3D rendering, Godot provides a **Rendering > Scaling 3D > Scale** "
"advanced project setting, which can be set above ``1.0`` to obtain "
"*supersample antialiasing*. The 3D rendering is then *downsampled* when it's "
"drawn on the viewport. This provides an expensive but high-quality form of "
"antialiasing, without increasing the final output resolution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider using this project setting first, as it avoids slowing down movie "
"writing speeds and increasing output file size compared to actually "
"increasing the output resolution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you wish to render 2D at a higher resolution, or if you actually need the "
"higher raw pixel output for 3D rendering, you can increase the resolution "
"above what the screen allows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Godot uses the ``disabled`` :ref:`stretch modes "
"<doc_multiple_resolutions>` in projects. If using ``disabled`` or "
"``canvas_items`` stretch mode, the window size dictates the output video "
"resolution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the other hand, if the project is configured to use the ``viewport`` "
"stretch mode, the viewport resolution dictates the output video resolution. "
"The viewport resolution is set using the **Display > Window > Size > "
"Viewport Width** and **Viewport Height** project settings. This can be used "
"to render a video at a higher resolution than the screen resolution."
msgstr ""

"The command below converts an AVI video to a MP4 (H.264) video with a "
