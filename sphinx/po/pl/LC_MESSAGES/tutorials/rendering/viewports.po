"Think of a :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` as a screen onto which the game "
"is projected. In order to see the game, we need to have a surface on which "
"to draw it. That surface is the Root Viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`SubViewports <class_SubViewport>` are a kind of Viewport that can be "
"added to the scene so that there are multiple surfaces to draw on. When we "
"are drawing to a SubViewport, we call it a render target. We can access the "
"contents of a render target by accessing its corresponding :ref:`texture "
"<class_Viewport_method_get_texture>`. By using a SubViewport as render "
"target, we can either render multiple scenes simultaneously or we can render "
"to a :ref:`ViewportTexture <class_ViewportTexture>` which is applied to an "
"object in the scene, for example a dynamic skybox."

msgid ""
"What all these use cases have in common is that you are given the ability to "
"draw objects to a texture as if it were another screen and can then choose "
"what to do with the resulting texture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another kind of Viewports in Godot are :ref:`Windows <class_Window>`. They "
"allow their content to be projected onto a window. While the Root Viewport "
"is a Window, they are less flexible. If you want to use the texture of a "
"Viewport, you'll be working with :ref:`SubViewports <class_SubViewport>` "
"most of the time."

msgid "Input"
msgstr "Wejście"

msgid ""
":ref:`Viewports <class_Viewport>` are also responsible for delivering "
"properly adjusted and scaled input events to their children nodes. By "
"default :ref:`SubViewports <class_SubViewport>` don't automatically receive "
"input, unless they receive it from their direct :ref:`SubViewportContainer "
"<class_SubViewportContainer>` parent node. In this case, input can be "
"disabled with the :ref:`Disable Input "
"<class_Viewport_property_gui_disable_input>` property."

msgid ""
"Godot supports 3D sound (in both 2D and 3D nodes). More on this can be found "
"in the :ref:`Audio Streams Tutorial <doc_audio_streams>`. For this type of "
"sound to be audible, the :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` needs to be "
"enabled as a listener (for 2D or 3D). If you are using a :ref:`SubViewport "
"<class_SubViewport>` to display your :ref:`World3D <class_World3D>` or :ref:"
"`World2D <class_World2D>`, don't forget to enable this!"

"When using a :ref:`Camera3D <class_Camera3D>` or :ref:`Camera2D "
"<class_Camera2D>`, it will always display on the closest parent :ref:"
"`Viewport <class_Viewport>` (going towards the root). For example, in the "
"following hierarchy:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``CameraA`` will display on the Root :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` and it "
"will draw ``MeshA``. ``CameraB`` will be captured by the :ref:`SubViewport "
"<class_SubViewport>` along with ``MeshB``. Even though ``MeshB`` is in the "
"scene hierarchy, it will still not be drawn to the Root Viewport. Similarly, "
"``MeshA`` will not be visible from the SubViewport because SubViewports only "
"capture nodes below them in the hierarchy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There can only be one active camera per :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`, so "
"if there is more than one, make sure that the desired one has the :ref:"
"`current <class_Camera3D_property_current>` property set, or make it the "
"current camera by calling:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, cameras will render all objects in their world. In 3D, cameras "
"can use their :ref:`cull_mask <class_Camera3D_property_cull_mask>` property "
"combined with the :ref:`VisualInstance3D's <class_VisualInstance3D>` :ref:"
"`layer <class_VisualInstance3D_property_layers>` property to restrict which "

msgid "Scale & stretching"
msgstr "Skala i rozciąganie"

msgid ""
":ref:`SubViewports <class_SubViewport>` have a :ref:"
"`size<class_SubViewport_property_size>` property, which represents the size "
"of the SubViewport in pixels. For SubViewports which are children of :ref:"
"`SubViewportContainers <class_SubViewportContainer>`, these values are "
"overridden, but for all others, this sets their resolution."

"For 3D, a :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` will contain a :ref:`World3D "
"<class_World3D>`. This is basically the universe that links physics and "
"rendering together. Node3D-based nodes will register using the World3D of "
"the closest Viewport. By default, newly created Viewports do not contain a "
"World3D but use the same as their parent Viewport. The Root Viewport always "
"contains a World3D, which is the one objects are rendered to by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :ref:`World3D <class_World3D>` can be set in a :ref:`Viewport "
"<class_Viewport>` using the :ref:`World "
"3D<class_Viewport_property_world_3d>` property, that will separate all "
"children nodes of this :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` and will prevent "
"them from interacting with the parent Viewport's World3D. This is especially "
"useful in scenarios where, for example, you might want to show a separate "
"character in 3D imposed over the game (like in StarCraft)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a helper for situations where you want to create :ref:`Viewports "
"<class_Viewport>` that display single objects and don't want to create a :"
"ref:`World3D <class_World3D>`, Viewport has the option to use its :ref:`Own "
"World3D <class_Viewport_property_own_world_3d>`. This is useful when you "
"want to instance 3D characters or objects in :ref:`World2D <class_World2D>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 2D, each :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` always contains its own :ref:"
"`World2D <class_World2D>`. This suffices in most cases, but in case sharing "
"them may be desired, it is possible to do so by setting :ref:"
"`world_2d<class_Viewport_property_world_2d>` on the Viewport through code."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But if you use this in ``_ready()`` or from the first frame of the :ref:"

msgid "Rendering"

msgid ""
"Due to the fact that the :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` is an entryway "
"into another rendering surface, it exposes a few rendering properties that "
"can be different from the project settings. You can choose to use a "
"different level of :ref:`MSAA <class_Viewport_property_msaa_2d>` for each "
"Viewport. The default behavior is ``Disabled``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you know that the :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` is only going to be "
"used for 2D, you can :ref:`Disable 3D<class_Viewport_property_disable_3d>`. "
"Godot will then restrict how the Viewport is drawn. Disabling 3D is slightly "
"faster and uses less memory compared to enabled 3D. It's a good idea to "
"disable 3D if your viewport doesn't render anything in 3D."
msgstr ""

"If you need to render 3D shadows in the viewport, make sure to set the "
"viewport's :ref:"
"`positional_shadow_atlas_size<class_Viewport_property_positional_shadow_atlas_size>` "

"By default, the equivalent project setting is set to ``4096`` on desktop "
"platforms and ``2048`` on mobile platforms."

"Godot also provides a way of customizing how everything is drawn inside :ref:"
"`Viewports <class_Viewport>` using :ref:`Debug "
"Draw<class_Viewport_property_debug_draw>`. Debug Draw allows you to specify "
"a mode which determines how the Viewport will display things drawn inside "
"it. Debug Draw is ``Disabled`` by default. Some other options are "
"``Unshaded``, ``Overdraw``, and ``Wireframe``. For a full list, refer to "

msgstr ""

msgid "**Debug Draw = Disabled** (default): The scene is drawn normally."

msgid ""
"**Debug Draw = Unshaded**: Unshaded draws the scene without using lighting "

msgid ""
"**Debug Draw = Overdraw**: Overdraw draws the meshes semi-transparent with "

"When rendering to a :ref:`SubViewport <class_SubViewport>`, whatever is "

"changed by setting :ref:`Clear "
"Mode<class_SubViewport_property_render_target_clear_mode>` to ``Never`` or "
"``Next Frame``. As the name implies, Never means the texture will never be "
"cleared, while next frame will clear the texture on the next frame and then "

"By default, re-rendering of the :ref:`SubViewport <class_SubViewport>` "
"happens when its :ref:`ViewportTexture <class_ViewportTexture>` has been "
"drawn in a frame. If visible, it will be rendered, otherwise, it will not. "
"This behavior can be changed by setting :ref:`Update "
"Mode<class_SubViewport_property_render_target_update_mode>` to ``Never``, "
"``Once``, ``Always``, or ``When Parent Visible``. Never and Always will "
"never or always re-render respectively. Once will re-render the next frame "
"and change to Never afterwards. This can be used to manually update the "
"Viewport. This flexibility allows users to render an image once and then use "
"the texture without incurring the cost of rendering every frame."
