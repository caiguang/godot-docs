"In Godot, class members can be exported. This means their value gets saved "
"along with the resource (such as the :ref:`scene <class_PackedScene>`) "
"they're attached to. They will also be available for editing in the property "
"editor. Exporting is done by using the ``[Export]`` attribute."

"One of the fundamental benefits of exporting member variables is to have "

"this, a special export syntax is provided."
msgstr ""
"Jedną z podstawowych korzyści płynących z eksportowania zmiennych jest ich "
"widoczność i możliwość edycji w edytorze. W ten sposób artyści i projektanci "
