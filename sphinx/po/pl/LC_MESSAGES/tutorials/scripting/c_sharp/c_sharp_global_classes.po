"Global classes (also known as named scripts) are types registered in Godot's "
"editor so they can be used more conveniently. These classes show up in the "
"*Add Node* and *Create Resource* dialogs, and :ref:`exported properties "
"<doc_c_sharp_exports>` are restricted to instances of the global class or "
"derived classes. Global classes are registered with the ``[GlobalClass]`` "
"attribute."

"The ``Stats`` class is a custom resource registered as a global class. :ref:"
"`Exporting properties <doc_c_sharp_exports>` of the type ``Stats`` will only "
