msgstr "Co to jest?"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Wprowadzenie"

msgid ""
"**GDExtension** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine interact "
"with native `shared libraries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries>`__ at run-time. You can use it to run "
"native code without compiling it with the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDExtension is *not* a scripting language and has no relation to :ref:"
"`GDScript <doc_gdscript>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Differences between GDExtension and C++ modules"
msgstr "Ogólne różnice między C# i GDScript"

msgid ""
"You can use both GDExtension and :ref:`C++ modules "
"<doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` to run C or C++ code in a Godot project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The "
"one you should choose depends on your needs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our long-term goal is that GDExtensions targeting an earlier version of "
"Godot will work in later minor versions, but not vice-versa. For example, a "
"GDExtension targeting Godot 4.2 should work just fine in Godot 4.3, but one "
"targeting Godot 4.3 won't work in Godot 4.2."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, GDExtension is currently *experimental*, which means that we may "
"break compatibility in order to fix major bugs or include critical features. "
"For example, GDExtensions created for Godot 4.0 aren't compatible with Godot "
"4.1 (see :ref:`updating_your_gdextension_for_godot_4_1`)."

msgid "Advantages of GDExtension"
msgstr "**Kategorie:**"

msgid ""
"Unlike modules, GDExtension doesn't require compiling the engine's source "
"code, making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most "
"of the API available to GDScript and C#, allowing you to code game logic "
"with full control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-"
"performance code you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset "
"library <doc_what_is_assetlib>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Also:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDExtension is not limited to C and C++. Thanks to :ref:`third-party "
"bindings <doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, you can use it with "
"many other languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use the same compiled GDExtension library in the editor and exported "
"project. With C++ modules, you have to recompile all the export templates "
"you plan to use if you require its functionality at run-time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDExtension only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. "
"That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. "
"Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with "
"incremental builds, this process is slower than using GDExtension."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advantages of C++ modules"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"We recommend :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` in cases where "
"GDExtension isn't enough:"
msgstr ""
"Obsługa :ref:`modułów C++ <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` osadzanych "
"bezpośrednio w wykonywalnym pliku binarnym silnika (statically linked)."

msgid ""
"C++ modules provide deeper integration into the engine. GDExtension's access "
"is not as deep as static modules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without "
"carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you notice that specific systems are not accessible via GDExtension but "
"are via custom modules, feel free to open an issue on the `godot-cpp "
"repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp>`__ to discuss "
"implementation options for exposing the missing functionality."

"languages (see below)."

msgid "Version compatibility"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDExtension add-ons compiled for a given Godot version are only guaranteed "
"to work with the same minor release series. For example, a GDExtension add-"
"on compiled for Godot 4.0 will only work with Godot 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2. In "
"addition, GDExtension is not compatible with Godot 3.x."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDExtension add-ons are also only compatible with engine builds that use the "
"level of floating-point precision the extension was compiled for. This means "
"that if you use a engine build with double-precision floats, the extension "
"must also be compiled for double-precision floats. See :ref:"
"`doc_large_world_coordinates` for details."
