"Godot includes text-to-speech functionality. You can find these under the :"
"ref:`DisplayServer class <class_DisplayServer>`."

"Godot depends on system libraries for text-to-speech functionality. These "
"libraries are installed by default on Windows and macOS, but not on all "
"Linux distributions. If they are not present, text-to-speech functionality "
"will not work. Specifically, the ``tts_get_voices()`` method will return an "
"empty list, indicating that there are no usable voices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both Godot users on Linux and end-users on Linux running Godot games need to "
"ensure that their system includes the system libraries for text-to-speech to "
"work. Please consult the table below or your own distribution's "
"documentation to determine what libraries you need to install."

msgid ""
"The best practices for text-to-speech, in terms of the ideal player "
"experience for blind players, is to send output to the player's screen "
"reader. This preserves the choice of language, speed, pitch, etc. that the "
"user set, as well as allows advanced features like allowing players to "
"scroll backward and forward through text. As of now, Godot doesn't provide "
"this level of integration."

"With the current state of the Godot text-to-speech APIs, best practices "
"include:"

msgid ""
"Develop the game with text-to-speech enabled, and ensure that everything "

"Allow players to control which voice to use, and save/persist that selection "

"Allow players to control the speech rate, and save/persist that selection "

"This provides your blind players with the most flexibility and comfort "

"frustrating and alienating them."

"Expect delays when you call `tts_speak` and `tts_stop`. The actual delay "
"time varies depending on both the OS and on your machine's specifications. "
"This is especially critical on Android and Web, where some of the voices "
"depend on web services, and the actual time to playback depends on server "
"load, network latency, and other factors."

"Non-English text works if the correct voices are installed and used. On "
"Windows, you can consult the instructions in `this article`_ to enable "
"additional language voices on Windows."

"Non-ASCII characters, such as umlaut, are pronounced correctly if you select "
"the correct voice."

"Blind players use a number of screen readers, including JAWS, NVDA, "
"VoiceOver, Narrator, and more."

"Windows text-to-speech APIs generally perform better than their equivalents "
