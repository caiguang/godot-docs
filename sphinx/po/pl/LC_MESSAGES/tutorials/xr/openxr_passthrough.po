msgid "The OpenXR passthrough"

msgid ""
"Passthrough is a technique where camera images are used to present the "
"environment of the user as the background. This turns a VR headset into an "
"AR headset, often referred to as Mixed Reality or MR."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As passthrough is relatively new there isn't a singular way this is "
"implemented across platforms. There may be additions in the future so this "
"is a work in progress."
msgstr ""

msgid "Passthrough extension"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"OpenXR has a vendor extension for passthrough submitted by Meta. Currently "
"this extension is only supported on Quest and PICO but may be adopted by "
"other headsets in the future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`XRInterface <class_xrinterface>` has entry points for passthrough so "
"different interfaces can implement this feature. For :ref:`OpenXRInterface "
"<class_openxrinterface>` the meta passthrough extension is implemented here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In code you can call ``is_passthrough_supported`` to check if this extension "
"is available. If so you can simply enable passthrough by calling "
"``start_passthrough``. You can call ``stop_passthrough`` to disable "
"passthrough."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You do need to make sure the background is transparent. You need to enable "
"the ``transparent_bg`` property on the viewport. Some background environment "
"settings will still fill the background with an opaque color, you can use a "
"``custom color`` with a color that has alpha set to 0."
msgstr ""

msgid "The OpenXR runtime will display the camera image as the background."
msgstr ""

msgid "For privacy reasons **no access** is given to the camera image."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After passthrough is enabled it is possible to change settings that will "
"break passthrough. Be sure not to disable the ``transparent_bg`` setting or "
"change the environment blend mode. This will result in the camera image no "
"longer being visible but you still incur the overhead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Always use ``stop_passthrough`` if you wish to turn off passthrough."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, for using passthrough on the Quest you must set the following "
"export property:"

msgid "Passthrough through AR"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of the headsets recently adding OpenXR support have taken a different "
"approach. They simply mimic being an AR device. The Lynx R1 is such a device "
"but others may be doing the same."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following thus applies to both passthrough devices that mimic AR, and "
"actual AR devices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``is_passthrough_supported`` returns false the next step is to call "
"``get_supported_environment_blend_modes``. This will return a list of "
"supported blend modes for submitting the main render image to OpenXR."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We need to check if ``XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND`` is present in this "
"list. If so we can tell OpenXR to expect an image that can be alpha blended "
"with a background. To do this, we simply call "
"``set_environment_blend_mode(xr_interface.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We must also set ``transparent_bg`` to true and adjust the environment to "
"ensure we submit the right image."
