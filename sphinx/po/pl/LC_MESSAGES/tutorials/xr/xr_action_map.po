msgid ""
"Godot has an action map feature as part of the XR system. At this point in "
"time this system is part of the OpenXR module. There are plans to encompass "
"WebXR into this in the near future hence we call it the XR action map system "
"in this document. It implements the built-in action map system of OpenXR "
"mostly exactly as it is offered."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The XR action map system exposes input, positional data and output for XR "
"controllers to your game/application. It does this by exposing named actions "
"that can be tailored to your game/application and binding these to the "
"actual inputs and outputs on your XR devices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As the XR action map is currently part of the OpenXR module, OpenXR needs to "
"be enabled in your project settings to expose it:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You will then find the XR Action Map interface in the bottom of the screen:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's built-in input system has many things in common with the XR action "
"map system. In fact our original idea was to add functionality to the "
"existing input system and expose the data to the OpenXR action map system. "
"We may revisit that idea at some point but as it turns out there were just "
"too many problems to overcome. To name a few:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's input system mainly centers around button inputs, XR adds triggers, "
"axis, poses and haptics (output) into the mix. This would greatly complicate "
"the input system with features that won't work for normal controllers or "
"contrast with the current approach. It was felt this would lead to confusion "
"for the majority of Godot users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's input system works with raw input data that is parsed and triggers "
"emitting actions. This input data is made available to the end user. OpenXR "
"completely hides raw data and does all the parsing for us, we only get "
"access to already parsed action data. This inconsistency is likely to lead "
"to bugs when an unsuspecting user tries to use an XR device as a normal "
"input device."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's input system allows changes to what inputs are bound to actions in "
"runtime, OpenXR does not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's input system is based on device ids which are meaningless in OpenXR."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This does mean that a game/application that mixes traditional inputs with XR "
"controllers will have a separation. For most applications either one or the "
"other is used and this is not seen as a problem. In the end, it's a "
"limitation of the system."

msgid "The default action map"
msgstr "Animacja"

msgid ""
"Godot will automatically create a default action map if no action map file "
"is found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This default map was designed to help developers port their XR games/"
"applications from Godot 3 to Godot 4. As a result this map essentially binds "
"all known inputs on all controllers supported by default, to actions one on "
"one. This is not a good example of setting up an action map. It does allow a "
"new developer to have a starting point when they want to become familiar "
"with Godot XR. It prevents having to design a proper action map for their "
"game/application first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this walkthrough we're going to start with a blank action map. You can "
"simply delete the \"Godot action set\" entry at the top by pressing the "
"trash can icon. This will clear out all actions. You might also want to "
"remove the controllers that you do not wish to setup, more on this later."

"Before we dive in, you will see the term XR runtime used throughout this "
"document. With XR runtime we mean the software that is controlling and "
"interacting with the AR or VR headset. The XR runtime then exposes this to "
"us through an API such as OpenXR. So:"

"The action map allows us to organize our actions in sets. Each set can be "
"enabled or disabled on its own."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The concept here is that you could have different sets that provide bindings "
"in different scenarios. You could have:"
msgstr ""

msgid "a ``Character control`` set for when you're walking around,"
msgstr ""

msgid "a ``Vehicle control`` set for when you're operating a vehicle,"

"Only the action set applicable to the current state of your game/application "
"can then be enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is especially important if you wish to bind the same input on a "
"controller to a different action. For instance:"
msgstr ""

msgid "in your ``Character control`` set you may have an action ``Jump``,"
msgstr ""

msgid "in your ``Vehicle control`` set you may have an action ``Accelerate``,"
msgstr ""

msgid "in your ``Menu`` set you may have an action ``Select``."
msgstr ""

msgid "All are bound to the trigger on your controller."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"OpenXR will only bind an input or output to a single action. If the same "
"input or output is bound to multiple actions the one in the active action "
"set with the highest priority will be the one updated/used. So in our above "
"example it will thus be important that only one action set is active."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For your first XR game/application we highly recommend starting with just a "
"single action set and to not over-engineer things."
msgstr ""

"For our walkthrough in this document we will thus create a single action set "
"called ``my_first_action_set``. We do this by pressing the ``Add action "

"These two are special as they are the only ones that are interchangeable. "
"OpenXR will handle conversions between ``Bool`` and ``Float`` inputs and "
"actions. You can get the value of a ``Float`` type action by calling the "
"method ``get_float`` on your :ref:`XRController3D <class_xrcontroller3d>` "
"node. It emits the ``input_float_changed`` signal when changed."
msgstr ""

"Where analogue inputs are queried as buttons a threshold is applied. This "

"plans to extend Godot to provide some level of control over these thresholds "

msgid ""
"The ``Vector2`` type defines the input as an axis input. Touchpads, "

"ref:`XRController3D <class_xrcontroller3d>` node. It emits the "
"``input_vector2_changed`` signal when changed."

"The ``Pose`` type defines a spatially tracked input. Multiple \"pose\" "

"`XRController3D <class_xrcontroller3d>` node is automatically positioned "
"based on the pose action assigned to ``pose`` property of this node. More "
"about poses later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The OpenXR implementation in Godot also exposes a special pose called "
"``Skeleton``. This is part of the hand tracking implementation. This pose is "
"exposed through the ``skeleton`` action that is supported outside of the "
"action map system. It is thus always present if hand tracking is supported. "
"You don't need to bind actions to this pose to use it."

"Finally, the only output type is ``Haptic`` and it allows us to set the "

msgid "Profiles"
msgstr "Profiler"

msgid ""
"In OpenXR controller bindings are captured in so-called \"Interaction "
"Profiles\". We've simply shortened it to \"Profiles\" because it takes up "
"less space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This generic name is chosen because controllers don't cover the entire "
"system. Currently there are also profiles for trackers, remotes and tracked "
"pens. There are also provisions for devices such as treadmills, haptic vests "
"and such even though those are not part of the specification yet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is important to know that OpenXR has strict checking on supported "
"devices. The core specification identifies a number of controllers and "
"similar devices with their supported inputs and outputs. Every XR runtime "
"must accept these interaction profiles even if they aren't applicable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"New devices are added through extensions and XR runtimes must specify which "
"ones they support. XR runtimes that do not support a device added through "
"extensions will not accept these profiles. XR runtimes that do not support "
"added input or output types will often crash if supplied."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As such Godot keeps meta data of all available devices, their inputs and "
"outputs and which extension adds support for them. You can create "
"interaction profiles for all devices you wish to support. Godot will filter "
"out those not supported by the XR runtime the user is using."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This does mean that in order to support new devices, you might need to "
"update to a more recent version of Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is however also important to note that the action map has been designed "
"with this in mind. When new devices enter the market, or when your users use "
"devices that you do not have access to, the action map system relies on the "
"XR runtime. It is the XR runtime's job to choose the best fitting "
"interaction profile that has been specified and adapt it for the controller "
"the user is using."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"How the XR runtime does this is left to the implementation of the runtime "
"and there are thus vast differences between the runtimes. Some runtimes "
"might even permit users to edit the bindings themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common approach for a runtime is to look for a matching interaction "
"profile first. If this is not found it will check the most common profiles "
"such as that of the \"Touch controller\" and do a conversion. If all else "
"fails, it will check the generic :ref:`\"Simple controller\" "
"<doc_xr_action_map_simple>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is an important conclusion to be made here: When a controller is "
"found, and the action map is applied to it, the XR runtime is not limited to "
"the exact configurations you set up in Godot's action map editor. While the "
"runtime will generally choose a suitable mapping based on one of the "
"bindings you set up in the action map, it can deviate from it."

"Finally, and this trips up a lot of people, the bindings aren't set in "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is the recommendation from the OpenXR Working Group that only bindings "
