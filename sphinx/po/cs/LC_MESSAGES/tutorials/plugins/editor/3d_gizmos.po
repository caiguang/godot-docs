"3D gizmo plugins are used by the editor and custom plugins to define the "
"gizmos attached to any kind of Node3D node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial shows the two main approaches to defining your own custom "
"gizmos. The first option works well for simple gizmos and creates less "
"clutter in your plugin structure, and the second one will let you store some "
"per-gizmo data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial assumes you already know how to make generic plugins. If in "
"doubt, refer to the :ref:`doc_making_plugins` page."
msgstr ""

msgid "The EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regardless of the approach we choose, we will need to create a new :ref:"
"`EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin <class_EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin>`. This will allow "
"us to set a name for the new gizmo type and define other behaviors such as "
"whether the gizmo can be hidden or not."
msgstr ""

msgid "This would be a basic setup:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For simple gizmos, inheriting :ref:`EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin "
"<class_EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin>` is enough. If you want to store some per-"
"gizmo data or you are porting a Godot 3.0 gizmo to 3.1+, you should go with "
"the second approach."
msgstr ""

msgid "Simple approach"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first step is to, in our custom gizmo plugin, override the :ref:"
"`_has_gizmo()<class_EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin_private_method__has_gizmo>` "
"method so that it returns ``true`` when the node parameter is of our target "
"type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then we can override methods like :ref:"
"`_redraw()<class_EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin_private_method__redraw>` or all the "
"handle related ones."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we created a material in the `_init` method, and retrieved it in "
"the `_redraw` method using :ref:"
"`get_material()<class_EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin_method_get_material>`. This "
"method retrieves one of the material's variants depending on the state of "
"the gizmo (selected and/or editable)."
msgstr ""

msgid "So the final plugin would look somewhat like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we just added some handles in the `_redraw` method, but we still "
"need to implement the rest of handle-related callbacks in :ref:"
"`EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin <class_EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin>` to get properly "
"working handles."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternative approach"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In some cases we want to provide our own implementation of :ref:"
"`EditorNode3DGizmo<class_EditorNode3DGizmo>`, maybe because we want to have "
"some state stored in each gizmo or because we are porting an old gizmo "
"plugin and we don't want to go through the rewriting process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In these cases all we need to do is, in our new gizmo plugin, override :ref:"
"`_create_gizmo()<class_EditorNode3DGizmoPlugin_private_method__create_gizmo>`, "
"so it returns our custom gizmo implementation for the Node3D nodes we want "
"to target."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This way all the gizmo logic and drawing methods can be implemented in a new "
"class extending :ref:`EditorNode3DGizmo<class_EditorNode3DGizmo>`, like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we just added some handles in the `_redraw` method, but we still "
"need to implement the rest of handle-related callbacks in :ref:"
"`EditorNode3DGizmo<class_EditorNode3DGizmo>` to get properly working handles."
