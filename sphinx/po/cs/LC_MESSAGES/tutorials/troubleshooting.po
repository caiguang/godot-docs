"The editor runs slowly and uses all my CPU and GPU resources, making my "
"computer noisy"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a known issue, especially on macOS since most Macs have Retina "
"displays. Due to Retina displays' higher pixel density, everything has to be "
"rendered at a higher resolution. This increases the load on the GPU and "
"decreases perceived performance."

"In 3D, click the **Perspective** button in the top left corner and enable "
"**Half Resolution**. The 3D viewport will now be rendered at half "
"resolution, which can be up to 4 times faster."

msgid ""
"Open the Editor Settings and increase the value of **Low Processor Mode "
"Sleep (µsec)** to ``33000`` (30 FPS). This value determines the amount of "
"*microseconds* between frames to render. Higher values will make the editor "
"feel less reactive but will help decrease CPU and GPU usage significantly."

msgid ""
"If you have a node that causes the editor to redraw continuously (such as "
"particles), hide it and show it using a script in the ``_ready()`` method. "
"This way, it will be hidden in the editor but will still be visible in the "
"running project."

"The editor stutters and flickers on my variable refresh rate monitor (G-Sync/"
"FreeSync)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a `known issue <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/"
"issues/38219>`__. Variable refresh rate monitors need to adjust their gamma "
"curves continuously to emit a consistent amount of light over time. This can "
"cause flicker to appear in dark areas of the image when the refresh rate "
"varies a lot, which occurs as the Godot editor only redraws when necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are several workarounds for this:"
msgstr "Existuje několik důvodů:"

msgid ""
"Enable **Interface > Editor > Update Continuously** in the Editor Settings. "
"Keep in mind this will increase power usage and heat/noise emissions since "
"the editor will now be rendering constantly, even if nothing has changed on "
"screen. To alleviate this, you can increase **Low Processor Mode Sleep "
"(µsec)** to ``33000`` (30 FPS) in the Editor Settings. This value determines "
"the amount of *microseconds* between frames to render. Higher values will "
"make the editor feel less reactive but will help decrease CPU and GPU usage "
"significantly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, disable variable refresh rate on your monitor or in the "
"graphics driver."

msgid ""
"VRR flicker can be reduced on some displays using the **VRR Control** or "
"**Fine Tune Dark Areas** options in your monitor's OSD. These options may "
"increase input lag or result in crushed blacks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If using an OLED display, use the **Black (OLED)** editor theme preset in "
"the Editor Settings. This hides VRR flicker thanks to OLED's perfect black "
"levels."

msgstr "Spuštění editoru nebo projektu trvá velmi dlouho"

msgid ""
"When using one of the Vulkan-based renderers (Forward+ or Forward Mobile), "
"the first startup is expected to be relatively long. This is because shaders "
"need to be compiled before they can be cached. Shaders also need to be "

"If the issue persists after the first startup, this is a `known bug <https://"
"github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20566>`__ on Windows when you have "
"specific USB peripherals connected. In particular, Corsair's iCUE software "
"seems to cause this bug. Try updating your USB peripherals' drivers to their "
"latest version. If the bug persists, you need to disconnect the specific "
"peripheral before opening the editor. You can then connect the peripheral "
"again."

"Zdá se, že chybu způsobil zejména software iCUE společnosti Corsair. Zkuste "
"aktualizovat ovladače periferních zařízení USB na nejnovější verzi. Pokud "
"chyba přetrvává, musíte před otevřením editoru odpojit vadné periferie. "
"Potom můžete periferní zařízení znovu připojit."

"Firewall software such as Portmaster may also cause the debug port to be "
"blocked. This causes the project to take a long time to start, while being "
"unable to use debugging features in the editor (such as viewing ``print()`` "
"output). You can work this around by changing the debug port used by the "
"project in the Editor Settings (**Network > Debug > Remote Port**). The "
"default is ``6007``; try another value that is greater than ``1024``, such "
"as ``7007``."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you open the Godot editor and manually change the position of the dock "
"icon, then restart the editor, you will get a duplicate dock icon all the "
"way to the right of the dock."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is due to a design limitation of the macOS dock. The only known way to "
"resolve this would be to merge the project manager and editor into a single "
"process, which means the project manager would no longer spawn a separate "
"process when starting the editor. While using a single process instance "
"would bring several benefits, it isn't planned to be done in the near future "
"due to the complexity of the task."
msgstr ""

"On Windows, this is usually caused by incorrect OS or monitor settings, as "
"Godot currently does not support :abbr:`HDR (High Dynamic Range)` *output* "
"(even though it may internally render in HDR)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As `most displays are not designed to display SDR content in HDR mode "
"<https://tftcentral.co.uk/articles/heres-why-you-should-only-enable-hdr-mode-"
"on-your-pc-when-you-are-viewing-hdr-content>`__, it is recommended to "
"disable HDR in the Windows settings when not running applications that use "
"HDR output. On Windows 11, this can be done by pressing :kbd:`Windows + Alt "
"+ B` (this shortcut is part of the Xbox Game Bar app). To toggle HDR "
"automatically based on applications currently running, you can use "
"`AutoActions <https://github.com/Codectory/AutoActions>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you insist on leaving HDR enabled, it is possible to somewhat improve the "
"result by ensuring the display is configured to use :abbr:`HGIG (HDR Gaming "
"Interest Group)` tonemapping (as opposed to :abbr:`DTM (Dynamic Tone "

"calibration-app-f30f4809-3369-43e4-9b02-9eabebd23f19>`__. It is also "
"strongly recommended to use Windows 11 instead of Windows 10 when using HDR. "
"The end result will still likely be inferior to disabling HDR on the "
"display, though."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a known issue on Linux with NVIDIA graphics when using the "
"proprietary driver. There is no definitive fix yet, as suspend on Linux + "
"NVIDIA is often buggy when OpenGL or Vulkan is involved. The Compatibility "
"rendering method (which uses OpenGL) is generally less prone to suspend-"

msgid ""
"The NVIDIA driver offers an *experimental* `option to preserve video memory "

"The project works when run from the editor, but fails to load some files "
"when running from an exported copy"
msgstr ""
"Projekt funguje při spuštění z editoru, ale při spuštění z exportované kopie "
"se mu nepodaří načíst některé soubory"

msgid ""
"This is usually caused by forgetting to specify a filter for non-resource "
"files in the Export dialog. By default, Godot will only include actual "
"*resources* into the PCK file. Some files commonly used, such as JSON files, "
"are not considered resources. For example, if you load ``test.json`` in the "
"exported project, you need to specify ``*.json`` in the non-resource export "
"filter. See :ref:`doc_exporting_projects_export_mode` for more information."
msgstr ""
"To je obvykle způsobeno opomenutím určit filtr souborů, které nejsou zdroji, "
"v dialogovém okně Export. Ve výchozím nastavení Godot zahrne do souboru PCK "
"pouze skutečné *zdroje* . Některé soubory, které se běžně používají, "
"například soubory JSON, se za zdroje nepovažují. Například pokud načítáte "
"soubor ``test.json`` v exportovaném projektu, musíte ve filtru exportu "
"souborů nepovažovaných za zdroje, zadat ``* .json``. Viz :ref:"
"`doc_exporting_projects_export_mode` pro více informací."

msgid ""
"Also, note that files and folders whose names begin with a period will never "
"be included in the exported project. This is done to prevent version control "
"folders like ``.git`` from being included in the exported PCK file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, this can also be due to :ref:`case sensitivity "
"<doc_project_organization_case_sensitivity>` issues. If you reference a "
"resource in your script with a different case than on the filesystem, "
"loading will fail once you export the project. This is because the virtual "
"PCK filesystem is case-sensitive, while Windows's filesystem is case-"
"insensitive by default."
msgstr ""
"V systému Windows to může být také způsobeno :ref:`problémy s rozlišením "
"malých a velkých písmen <doc_project_organization_case_sensitivity>` . Pokud "
"ve svém skriptu uvedete odkaz na zdroj jinou velikostí písma, než je v "
"souborovém systému, načítání se po exportu projektu nezdaří. Je tomu tak "
"proto, že ve virtuálním souborovém systému PCK se rozlišují velká a malá "
"písmena, zatímco v systému souborů Windows se ve výchozím nastavení velká a "
"malá písmena nerozlišují."
