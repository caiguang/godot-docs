msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Úvod"

msgid ""
":ref:`class_Label` nodes are great for displaying basic text, but they have "
"limitations. If you want to change the color of the text, or its alignment, "
"you can only do that to the entire label. You can't make a part of the text "
"have another color, or have a part of the text centered. To get around these "
"limitations, you would use a :ref:`class_RichTextLabel`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`class_RichTextLabel` allows for complex formatting of text using a "
"markup syntax or the built-in API. It uses BBCodes for the markup syntax, a "
"system of tags that designate formatting rules for a part of the text. You "
"may be familiar with them if you ever used forums (also known as `bulletin "
"boards`, hence the \"BB\" in \"BBCode\")."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike Label, RichTextLabel also comes with its own vertical scrollbar. This "
"scrollbar is automatically displayed if the text does not fit within the "
"control's size. The scrollbar can be disabled by unchecking the **Scroll "
"Active** property in the RichTextLabel inspector."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the BBCode tags can also be used to some extent in the XML source "
"of the class reference. For more information, see :ref:"
"`doc_class_reference_primer`."

"You can see how BBCode in RichTextLabel works in action using the `Rich Text "
"Label with BBCode demo project <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-"
"projects/tree/master/gui/rich_text_bbcode>`__."
msgstr ""
"Pokud vám při učení vyhovují více příklady, můžete se také podívat na různé "
"\"Godot demo projekty <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-"
"projects\"'_."

msgid "Using BBCode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, :ref:`class_RichTextLabel` functions like a normal :ref:"
"`class_Label`. It has the :ref:`property_text "
"<class_RichTextLabel_property_text>` property, which you can edit to have "
"uniformly formatted text. To be able to use BBCode for rich text formatting, "
"you need to turn on the BBCode mode by setting :ref:`bbcode_enabled "
"<class_RichTextLabel_property_bbcode_enabled>`. After that, you can edit "
"the :ref:`text <class_RichTextLabel_property_text>` property using available "
"tags. Both properties are located at the top of the inspector after "
"selecting a RichTextLabel node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, ``BBCode [color=green]test[/color]`` would render the word "
"\"test\" with a green color."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most BBCodes consist of 3 parts: the opening tag, the content and the "
"closing tag. The opening tag delimits the start of the formatted part, and "
"can also carry some configuration options. Some opening tags, like the "
"``color`` one shown above, also require a value to work. Other opening tags "
"may accept multiple options (separated by spaces within the opening tag). "
"The closing tag delimits the end of the formatted part. In some cases, both "
"the closing tag and the content can be omitted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike BBCode in HTML, leading/trailing whitespace is not removed by a "
"RichTextLabel upon display. Duplicate spaces are also displayed as-is in the "
"final output. This means that when displaying a code block in a "
"RichTextLabel, you don't need to use a preformatted text tag."
msgstr ""

"RichTextLabel doesn't support entangled BBCode tags. For example, instead of "
"using:"

msgid "Use:"

msgid "Handling user input safely"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In a scenario where users may freely input text (such as chat in a "
"multiplayer game), you should make sure users cannot use arbitrary BBCode "
"tags that will be parsed by RichTextLabel. This is to avoid inappropriate "
"use of formatting, which can be problematic if ``[url]`` tags are handled by "
"your RichTextLabel (as players may be able to create clickable links to "
"phishing sites or similar)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using RichTextLabel's ``[lb]`` and/or ``[rb]`` tags, we can replace the "
"opening and/or closing brackets of any BBCode tag in a message with those "
"escaped tags. This prevents users from using BBCode that will be parsed as "
"tags – instead, the BBCode will be displayed as text."

msgid "Stripping BBCode tags"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For certain use cases, it can be desired to remove BBCode tags from the "
"string. This is useful when displaying the RichTextLabel's text in another "
"Control that does not support BBCode (such as a tooltip):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Removing BBCode tags entirely isn't advised for user input, as it can modify "
"the displayed text without users understanding why part of their message was "
"removed. :ref:`Escaping user input "
"<doc_bbcode_in_richtextlabel_handling_user_input_safely>` should be "
"preferred instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Performance"
msgstr "Výkon"

msgid ""
"In most cases, you can use BBCode directly as-is since text formatting is "
"rarely a heavy task. However, with particularly large RichTextLabels (such "
"as console logs spanning thousands of lines), you may encounter stuttering "
"during gameplay when the RichTextLabel's text is updated."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are several ways to alleviate this:"
msgstr "Existují dva hlavní způsoby, jak zmírnit páskování:"

msgid ""
"Use the ``append_text()`` function instead of appending to the ``text`` "
"property. This function will only parse BBCode for the added text, rather "
"than parsing BBCode from the entire ``text`` property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``push_[tag]()`` and ``pop()`` functions to add tags to RichTextLabel "
"instead of using BBCode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enable the **Threading > Threaded** property in RichTextLabel. This won't "
"speed up processing, but it will prevent the main thread from blocking, "
"which avoids stuttering during gameplay. Only enable threading if it's "
"actually needed in your project, as threading has some overhead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using push_[tag]() and pop() functions instead of BBCode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't want to use BBCode for performance reasons, you can use "
"functions provided by RichTextLabel to create formatting tags without "
"writing BBCode in the text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every BBCode tag (including effects) has a ``push_[tag]()`` function (where "
"``[tag]`` is the tag's name). There are also a few convenience functions "
"available, such as ``push_bold_italics()`` that combines both "
"``push_bold()`` and ``push_italics()`` into a single tag. See the :ref:"
"`RichTextLabel class reference <class_RichTextLabel>` for a complete list of "
"``push_[tag]()`` functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``pop()`` function is used to end *any* tag. Since BBCode is a tag "
"*stack*, using ``pop()`` will close the most recently started tags first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following script will result in the same visual output as using ``BBCode "
"[color=green]test [i]example[/i][/color]``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do **not** set the ``text`` property directly when using formatting "
"functions. Appending to the ``text`` property will erase all modifications "
"made to the RichTextLabel using the ``append_text()``, ``push_[tag]()`` and "
