msgid ""
"A tilemap is a grid of tiles used to create a game's layout. There are "
"several benefits to using :ref:`TileMap <class_TileMap>` nodes to design "
"your levels. First, they make it possible to draw the layout by \"painting\" "
"the tiles onto a grid, which is much faster than placing individual :ref:"
"`Sprite2D <class_Sprite2D>` nodes one by one. Second, they allow for much "
"larger levels because they are optimized for drawing large numbers of tiles. "
"Finally, you can add collision, occlusion, and navigation shapes to tiles, "
"adding greater functionality to the TileMap."
msgstr ""

msgid "Specifying the TileSet in the TileMap"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you've followed the previous page on :ref:`doc_using_tilesets`, you "
"should have a TileSet resource that is built-in to the TileMap node. This is "
"good for prototyping, but in a real world project, you will generally have "
"multiple levels reusing the same tileset."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The recommended way to reuse the same TileSet in several TileMap nodes is to "
"save the TileSet to an external resource. To do so, click the dropdown next "
"to the TileSet resource and choose **Save**:"

msgid "Creating TileMap layers"
msgstr "Vytvoření scény hráče"

msgid ""
"As of Godot 4.0, you can place several *layers* in a single TileMap node. "
"For example, this allows you to distinguish foreground tiles from background "
"tiles for better organization. You can place one tile per layer at a given "
"location, which allows you to overlap several tiles together if you have "
"more than one layer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, a TileMap node automatically has one premade layer. You do not "
"have to create additional layers if you only need a single layer, but if you "
"wish to do so now, select the TileMap node and unfold the **Layers** section "
"in the inspector:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating layers in a TileMap node (example with \"background\" and "
"\"foreground\")"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each layer has several properties you can adjust:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Name:** A human-readable name to display in the TileMap editor. This can "
"be something like \"background\", \"buildings\", \"vegetation\", etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Enabled:** If ``true``, the layer is visible in the editor and when "
"running the project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Modulate:** The color to use as a multiplier for all tiles on the layer. "
"This is also multiplied with the per-tile **Modulate** property and the "
"TileMap node's **Modulate** property. For example, you can use this to "
"darken background tiles to make foreground tiles stand out more."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Y Sort Enabled:** If ``true``, sorts tiles based on their Y position on "
"the TileMap. This can be used to prevent sorting issues with certain tile "
"setups, especially with isometric tiles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Y Sort Origin:** The vertical offset to use for Y-sorting on each tile (in "
"pixels). Only effective if **Y Sort Enabled** is ``true``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Z Index:** Controls whether this layer is drawn in front of or behind "
"other TileMap layers. This value can be positive or negative; the layer with "
"the highest Z Index is drawn on top of other layers. If several layers have "
"an equal Z Index property, the layer that is *last* in the list of layers "
"(the one which appears at the bottom in the list) is drawn on top."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can reorder layers by drag-and-dropping the \"three horizontal bars\" "
"icon on the left of the entries in the **Layers** section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create, rename or reorder layers in the future without affecting "
"existing tiles. Be careful though, as *removing* a layer will also remove "
"all tiles that were placed on the layer."
