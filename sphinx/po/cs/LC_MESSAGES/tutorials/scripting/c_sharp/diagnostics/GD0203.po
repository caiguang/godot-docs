"Every signal must return ``void``. There can be multiple callbacks "
"registered for each signal, if signal callbacks could return something it "
"wouldn't be possible to determine which of the returned values to use."

msgid "How to fix violations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To fix a violation of this rule, change the delegate to return ``void`` or "
"remove the ``[Signal]`` attribute from the delegate. Note that removing the "
"attribute will mean the signal is not registered."

msgid ""
"If the signal doesn't need to interact with Godot, consider using `C# events "
"<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/events/"
">`_ directly. Pure C# events allow you to use any C# type for its parameters."

msgid ""
"Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Signal delegates that return "
"something will result in unexpected runtime errors."
