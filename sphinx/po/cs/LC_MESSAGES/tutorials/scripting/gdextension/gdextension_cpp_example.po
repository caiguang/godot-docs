msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Úvod"

msgid ""
"The C++ bindings for GDExtension are built on top of the C GDExtension API "
"and provide a nicer way to \"extend\" nodes and other built-in classes in "
"Godot using C++. This new system allows the extension of Godot to nearly the "
"same level as statically linked C++ modules."

msgid "Setting up the project"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are a few prerequisites you'll need:"
msgstr ""

msgid "a Godot 4 executable,"
msgstr ""

msgid "a C++ compiler,"
msgstr ""

msgid "SCons as a build tool,"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"a copy of the `godot-cpp repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-"
"cpp>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See also :ref:`Compiling <toc-devel-compiling>` as the build tools are "
"identical to the ones you need to compile Godot from source."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can download the `godot-cpp repository <https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot-cpp>`__ from GitHub or let Git do the work for you. Note that this "
"repository has different branches for different versions of Godot. "
"GDExtensions will not work in older versions of Godot (only Godot 4 and up) "
"and vice versa, so make sure you download the correct branch."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To use `GDExtension <https://godotengine.org/article/introducing-gd-"
"extensions>`__ you need to use the godot-cpp branch that matches the version "
"of Godot that you are targeting. For example, if you're targeting Godot 4.1, "
"use the ``4.1`` branch, which is what is shown through out this tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``master`` branch is the development branch which is updated regularly "
"to work with Godot's ``master`` branch."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Our long-term goal is that GDExtensions targeting an earlier version of "
"Godot will work in later minor versions, but not vice-versa. For example, a "
"GDExtension targeting Godot 4.2 should work just fine in Godot 4.3, but one "
"targeting Godot 4.3 won't work in Godot 4.2."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, GDExtension is currently *experimental*, which means that we may "
"break compatibility in order to fix major bugs or include critical features. "
"For example, GDExtensions created for Godot 4.0 aren't compatible with Godot "
"4.1 (see :ref:`updating_your_gdextension_for_godot_4_1`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are versioning your project using Git, it is recommended to add it as "
"a Git submodule:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternatively, you can also clone it to the project folder:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you decide to download the repository or clone it into your folder, make "
"sure to keep the folder layout the same as we've setup here. Much of the "
"code we'll be showcasing here assumes the project has this layout."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you cloned the example from the link specified in the introduction, the "
"submodules are not automatically initialized. You will need to execute the "
"following commands:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This will initialize the repository in your project folder."
msgstr ""

msgid "Building the C++ bindings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that we've downloaded our prerequisites, it is time to build the C++ "
"bindings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The repository contains a copy of the metadata for the current Godot "
"release, but if you need to build these bindings for a newer version of "
"Godot, simply call the Godot executable:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The resulting ``extension_api.json`` file will be created in the "
"executable's directory. Copy it to the project folder and add "
"``custom_api_file=<PATH_TO_FILE>`` to the scons command below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To generate and compile the bindings, use this command (replacing "
"``<platform>`` with ``windows``, ``linux`` or ``macos`` depending on your "
"OS):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The build process automatically detects the number of CPU threads to use for "
"parallel builds. To specify a number of CPU threads to use, add ``-jN`` at "
"the end of the SCons command line where ``N`` is the number of CPU threads "
"to use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This step will take a while. When it is completed, you should have static "
"libraries that can be compiled into your project stored in ``godot-cpp/bin/"
"``."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may need to add ``bits=64`` to the command on Windows or Linux."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating a simple plugin"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now it's time to build an actual plugin. We'll start by creating an empty "
"Godot project in which we'll place a few files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open Godot and create a new project. For this example, we will place it in a "
"folder called ``demo`` inside our GDExtension's folder structure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our demo project, we'll create a scene containing a Node called \"Main\" "
"and we'll save it as ``main.tscn``. We'll come back to that later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Back in the top-level GDExtension module folder, we're also going to create "
"a subfolder called ``src`` in which we'll place our source files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should now have ``demo``, ``godot-cpp``, and ``src`` directories in your "
"GDExtension module."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Your folder structure should now look like this:"
msgstr "Vaše scéna by měla vypadat takto:"

msgid ""
"In the ``src`` folder, we'll start with creating our header file for the "
"GDExtension node we'll be creating. We will name it ``gdexample.h``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are a few things of note to the above. We include ``sprite2d.hpp`` "
"which contains bindings to the Sprite2D class. We'll be extending this class "
"in our module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We're using the namespace ``godot``, since everything in GDExtension is "
"defined within this namespace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then we have our class definition, which inherits from our Sprite2D through "
"a container class. We'll see a few side effects of this later on. The "
"``GDCLASS`` macro sets up a few internal things for us."
msgstr ""

msgid "After that, we declare a single member variable called ``time_passed``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the next block we're defining our methods, we have our constructor and "
"destructor defined, but there are two other functions that will likely look "
"familiar to some, and one new method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first is ``_bind_methods``, which is a static function that Godot will "
"call to find out which methods can be called and which properties it "
"exposes. The second is our ``_process`` function, which will work exactly "
"the same as the ``_process`` function you're used to in GDScript."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's implement our functions by creating our ``gdexample.cpp`` file:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This one should be straightforward. We're implementing each method of our "
"class that we defined in our header file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note our ``_process`` function, which keeps track of how much time has "
"passed and calculates a new position for our sprite using a sine and cosine "
"function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is one more C++ file we need; we'll name it ``register_types.cpp``. "
"Our GDExtension plugin can contain multiple classes, each with their own "
"header and source file like we've implemented ``GDExample`` up above. What "
"we need now is a small bit of code that tells Godot about all the classes in "
"our GDExtension plugin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``initialize_example_module`` and ``uninitialize_example_module`` "
"functions get called respectively when Godot loads our plugin and when it "
"unloads it. All we're doing here is parse through the functions in our "
"bindings module to initialize them, but you might have to set up more things "
"depending on your needs. We call the function ``register_class`` for each of "
"our classes in our library."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The important function is the third function called "
"``example_library_init``. We first call a function in our bindings library "
"that creates an initialization object. This object registers the "
"initialization and termination functions of the GDExtension. Furthermore, it "
"sets the level of initialization (core, servers, scene, editor, level)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At last, we need the header file for the ``register_types.cpp`` named "
"``register_types.h``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compiling the plugin"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We cannot easily write by hand a ``SConstruct`` file that SCons would use "
"for building. For the purpose of this example, just use :download:`this "
"hardcoded SConstruct file <files/cpp_example/SConstruct>` we've prepared. "
"We'll cover a more customizable, detailed example on how to use these build "
"files in a subsequent tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This ``SConstruct`` file was written to be used with the latest ``godot-"
"cpp`` master, you may need to make small changes using it with older "
"versions or refer to the ``SConstruct`` file in the Godot 4.0 documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you've downloaded the ``SConstruct`` file, place it in your GDExtension "
"folder structure alongside ``godot-cpp``, ``src`` and ``demo``, then run:"
msgstr ""

msgid "You should now be able to find the module in ``demo/bin/<platform>``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here, we've compiled both godot-cpp and our gdexample library as debug "
"builds. For optimized builds, you should compile them using the "
"``target=template_release`` switch."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Using the GDExtension module"
msgstr "Použití profileru Godota."

msgid ""
"Before we jump back into Godot, we need to create one more file in ``demo/"
"bin/``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This file lets Godot know what dynamic libraries should be loaded for each "
"platform and the entry function for the module. It is called ``gdexample."
"gdextension``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This file contains a ``configuration`` section that controls the entry "
"function of the module. You should also set the minimum compatible Godot "
"version with ``compatability_minimum``, which prevents older version of "
"Godot from trying to load your extension."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``libraries`` section is the important bit: it tells Godot the location "
"of the dynamic library in the project's filesystem for each supported "
"platform. It will also result in *just* that file being exported when you "
"export the project, which means the data pack won't contain libraries that "
"are incompatible with the target platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, the ``dependencies`` section allows you to name additional dynamic "
"libraries that should be included as well. This is important when your "
"GDExtension plugin implements someone else's library and requires you to "
"supply a third-party dynamic library with your project."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is another overview to check the correct file structure:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Time to jump back into Godot. We load up the main scene we created way back "
"in the beginning and now add a newly available GDExample node to the scene:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We're going to assign the Godot logo to this node as our texture, disable "
"the ``centered`` property:"
msgstr ""

msgid "We're finally ready to run the project:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Custom editor icon"
msgstr "Vlastní shadery"

msgid ""
"By default, Godot uses the node icon in the scene dock for GDExtension "
"nodes. The custom icon can be added via the ``gdextension`` file. The node's "
"icon is set by reference to its name and resource path of an SVG file."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The path should point to a 16 by 16 pixel SVG image. Read the guide for :ref:"
"`creating icons <doc_editor_icons>` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding properties"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDScript allows you to add properties to your script using the ``export`` "
"keyword. In GDExtension you have to register the properties with a getter "
"and setter function or directly implement the ``_get_property_list``, "
"``_get`` and ``_set`` methods of an object (but that goes far beyond the "
"scope of this tutorial)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lets add a property that allows us to control the amplitude of our wave."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our ``gdexample.h`` file we need to add a member variable and getter and "
"setter functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our ``gdexample.cpp`` file we need to make a number of changes, we will "
"only show the methods we end up changing, don't remove the lines we're "
"omitting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you compile the module with these changes in place, you will see that a "
"property has been added to our interface. You can now change this property "
"and when you run your project, you will see that our Godot icon travels "
"along a larger figure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's do the same but for the speed of our animation and use a setter and "
"getter function. Our ``gdexample.h`` header file again only needs a few more "
"lines of code:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This requires a few more changes to our ``gdexample.cpp`` file, again we're "
"only showing the methods that have changed so don't remove anything we're "
"omitting:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now when the project is compiled, we'll see another property called speed. "
"Changing its value will make the animation go faster or slower. Furthermore, "
"we added a property range which describes in which range the value can be. "
"The first two arguments are the minimum and maximum value and the third is "
"the step size."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For simplicity, we've only used the hint_range of the property method. There "
"are a lot more options to choose from. These can be used to further "
"configure how properties are displayed and set on the Godot side."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signals"
msgstr "Signály"

msgid ""
"Last but not least, signals fully work in GDExtension as well. Having your "
"extension react to a signal given out by another object requires you to call "
"``connect`` on that object. We can't think of a good example for our "
"wobbling Godot icon, we would need to showcase a far more complete example."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the required syntax:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To connect our signal ``the_signal`` from some other node with our method "
"``my_method``, we need to provide the ``connect`` method with the name of "
"the signal and a ``Callable``. The ``Callable`` holds information about an "
"object on which a method can be called. In our case, it associates our "
"current object instance ``this`` with the method ``my_method`` of the "
"object. Then the ``connect`` method will add this to the observers of "
"``the_signal``. Whenever ``the_signal`` is now emitted, Godot knows which "
"method of which object it needs to call."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that you can only call ``my_method`` if you've previously registered it "
"in your ``_bind_methods`` method. Otherwise Godot will not know about the "
"existence of ``my_method``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To learn more about ``Callable``, check out the class reference here: :ref:"
"`Callable <class_Callable>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Having your object sending out signals is more common. For our wobbling "
"Godot icon, we'll do something silly just to show how it works. We're going "
"to emit a signal every time a second has passed and pass the new location "
"along."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our ``gdexample.h`` header file, we need to define a new member "
"``time_emit``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This time, the changes in ``gdexample.cpp`` are more elaborate. First, "
"you'll need to set ``time_emit = 0.0;`` in either our ``_init`` method or in "
"our constructor. We'll look at the other 2 needed changes one by one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our ``_bind_methods`` method, we need to declare our signal. This is done "
"as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here, our ``ADD_SIGNAL`` macro can be a single call with a ``MethodInfo`` "
"argument. ``MethodInfo``'s first parameter will be the signal's name, and "
"its remaining parameters are ``PropertyInfo`` types which describe the "
"essentials of each of the method's parameters. ``PropertyInfo`` parameters "
"are defined with the data type of the parameter, and then the name that the "
"parameter will have by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So here, we add a signal, with a ``MethodInfo`` which names the signal "
"\"position_changed\". The ``PropertyInfo`` parameters describe two essential "
"arguments, one of type ``Object``, the other of type ``Vector2``, "
"respectively named \"node\" and \"new_pos\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Next, we'll need to change our ``_process`` method:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After a second has passed, we emit our signal and reset our counter. We can "
"add our parameter values directly to ``emit_signal``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the GDExtension library is compiled, we can go into Godot and select "
"our sprite node. In the **Node** dock, we can find our new signal and link "
"it up by pressing the **Connect** button or double-clicking the signal. "
"We've added a script on our main node and implemented our signal like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Every second, we output our position to the console."
msgstr ""

msgid "Next steps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We hope the above example showed you the basics. You can build upon this "
"example to create full-fledged scripts to control nodes in Godot using C++."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "Stav překladu"
