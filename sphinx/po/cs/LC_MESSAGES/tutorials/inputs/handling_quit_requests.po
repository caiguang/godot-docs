"Most platforms have the option to request the application to quit. On "
"desktops, this is usually done with the \"x\" icon on the window title bar. "
"On Android, the back button is used to quit when on the main screen (and to "
"go back otherwise)."

msgid "Handling the notification"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On desktop and web platforms, :ref:`Node <class_Node>` receives a special "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` notification when quitting is requested "
"from the window manager."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Android, ``NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` is sent instead. Pressing "
"the Back button will exit the application if **Application > Config > Quit "
"On Go Back** is checked in the Project Settings (which is the default)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` isn't supported on iOS, as iOS devices "
"don't have a physical Back button."

"When developing mobile apps, quitting is not desired unless the user is on "
"the main screen, so the behavior can be changed."

msgid ""
"It is important to note that by default, Godot apps have the built-in "
"behavior to quit when quit is requested from the window manager. This can be "
"changed, so that the user can take care of the complete quitting procedure:"

msgid "Sending your own quit notification"
msgstr "Odesílání vlastního oznámení o ukončení"

msgid ""
"While forcing the application to close can be done by calling :ref:"
"`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>`, doing so will not send the "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` to the nodes in the scene tree. Quitting "
"by calling :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` will not "
"allow custom actions to complete (such as saving, confirming the quit, or "
"debugging), even if you try to delay the line that forces the quit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, if you want to notify the nodes in the scene tree about the "
"upcoming program termination, you should send the notification yourself:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sending this notification will inform all nodes about the program "
"termination, but will not terminate the program itself *unlike in 3.X*. In "
"order to achieve the previous behavior, :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` should be called after the notification."
