"Godot prides itself on being very easy to build, by C++ projects' "
"standards. :ref:`Godot uses the SCons build system <doc_faq_why_scons>`, and "
"after the initial setup compiling the engine for your current platform "
"should be as easy as running::"

"But you will probably need to use at least some of the available options to "
"configure the build to match your specific needs, be it a custom engine "
"fork, a lightweight build stripped of extra modules, or an executable "
"targetting engine development."

"The articles below should help you navigate configuration options available, "

"Below you can find instructions for compiling the engine for your specific "
"target platform. Note that Godot supports cross-compilation, which means you "
"can compile it for a target platform that doesn't match your current "
"platform (say, target Linux while being on Windows). The guides will try "
"their best to cover all possible situations."

"Some additional universal compilation options require further setup. Namely, "
"while Godot does have C#/.NET support as a part of its main codebase, it "
"does not get compiled by default to reduce the executable size for users who "
"don't need C# for their projects."
