"If you already use Visual Studio as your main IDE, you can use the same "
"solution file in Rider. Rider and Visual Studio use the same solution "
"format, so you can switch between the two IDEs without rebuilding the "
"solution file. Debug configurations need to be changed when going from one "
"IDE to another."

"If you have Rider setup as your main IDE for .sln, you can now open the "
"project by double-clicking on the ``godot.sln`` in the project root or by "

"Rider could fail to build the first time you open the project. If that is "
"the case, you can close Rider and open the solution in Visual Studio, build "
"it, close Visual Studio, and open the solution in Rider again. You are now "
"able to build the project from Rider."
