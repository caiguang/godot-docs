"This lesson will give you an overview of the available scripting languages "
"in Godot. You will learn the pros and cons of each option. In the next part, "
"you will write your first script using GDScript."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Scripts attach to a node and extend its behavior**. This means that "
"scripts inherit all functions and properties of the node they attach to."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, take a game where a Camera2D node follows a ship. The Camera2D "
"node follows its parent by default. Imagine you want the camera to shake "
"when the player takes damage. As this feature is not built into Godot, you "
"would attach a script to the Camera2D node and code the shake."

msgid "Available scripting languages"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot offers **four gameplay programming languages**: GDScript, C#, and, via "
"its GDExtension technology, C and C++. There are more community-supported "
"languages, but these are the official ones."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use multiple languages in a single project. For instance, in a team, "
"you could code gameplay logic in GDScript as it's fast to write, and use C# "
"or C++ to implement complex algorithms and maximize their performance. Or "
"you can write everything in GDScript or C#. It's your call."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We provide this flexibility to answer the needs of different game projects "
"and developers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Which language should I use?"
msgstr "Jaký jazyk mám použít?"

msgid ""
"If you're a beginner, we recommend to **start with GDScript**. We made this "
"language specifically for Godot and the needs of game developers. It has a "
"lightweight and straightforward syntax and provides the tightest integration "
"with Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For C#, you will need an external code editor like `VSCode <https://code."
"visualstudio.com/>`_ or Visual Studio. While C# support is now mature, you "
"will find fewer learning resources for it compared to GDScript. That's why "
"we recommend C# mainly to users who already have experience with the "
"language."

msgid "Let's look at each language's features, as well as its pros and cons."

"wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming>`_ programming language built for "
"Godot. It's made by and for game developers to save you time coding games. "
"Its features include:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A simple syntax that leads to short files."

msgid "Blazing fast compilation and loading times."

"Tight editor integration, with code completion for nodes, signals, and more "
"information from the scene it's attached to."
msgstr ""
"Díky integrovanému editoru je potěšením pracovat s automatickým dokončováním "
"kódu pro uzly, signály a ostaní prvky právě editované scény."

msgid ""
"Built-in vector and transform types, making it efficient for heavy use of "
"linear algebra, a must for games."
msgstr ""
"Má vestavěné vektorové typy (například vektory, transformace atd.), Díky "
"tomuto je efektivní pro náročné použití lineární algebry, což je pro hry "

msgid "Supports multiple threads as efficiently as statically typed languages."
msgstr "Menší výkon než staticky typované jazyky."

msgid ""
"No `garbage collection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>`_, as this feature eventually gets in "
"the way when creating games. The engine counts references and manages the "
"memory for you in most cases by default, but you can also control memory if "
"you need to."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Gradual typing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing>`_. Variables "
"have dynamic types by default, but you also can use type hints for strong "
"type checks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDScript looks like Python as you structure your code blocks using "
"indentations, but it doesn't work the same way in practice. It's inspired by "
"multiple languages, including Squirrel, Lua, and Python."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why don't we use Python or Lua directly?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Years ago, Godot used Python, then Lua. Both languages' integration took a "
"lot of work and had severe limitations. For example, threading support was a "
"big challenge with Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Developing a dedicated language doesn't take us more work and we can tailor "
"it to game developers' needs. We're now working on performance optimizations "
"and features that would've been difficult to offer with third-party "
"languages."

"As Microsoft's `C# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"C_Sharp_(programming_language)>`_ is a favorite amongst game developers, we "
"officially support it. C# is a mature and flexible language with tons of "
"libraries written for it. We were able to add support for it thanks to a "
"generous donation from Microsoft."
msgstr ""
"Protože Microsoft `C# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"C_Sharp_(programming_language)>`_ je mezi vývojáři her oblíbený, přidali "
"jsme pro něj oficiální podporu. C # je vyspělý jazyk ve kterém jsou napsány "
"tuny aplikaci a podpora byla přidána díky štědrému daru od společnosti "
"Microsoft."

msgid ""
"C# offers a good tradeoff between performance and ease of use, although you "
"should be aware of its garbage collector."
msgstr ""
"Představuje vynikající kompromis mezi výkonem a jednoduchostí použití, "

"Since Godot uses .NET 6, in theory, you can use any third-party .NET library "
"or framework in Godot, as well as any Common Language Infrastructure-"
"compliant programming language, such as F#, Boo, or ClojureCLR. However, C# "
"is the only officially supported .NET option."
msgstr ""
"Protože Godot používá runtime `Mono <https://mono-project.com>`_ .NET, "
"teoreticky lze pro skriptování v Godot i jakoukoli běžnou jazykovou "
"infrastrukturu použít jakoukoli knihovnu nebo framework .NET od třetích "
"stran. kompatibilní programovací jazyk, jako je F #, Boo nebo ClojureCLR. V "
"praxi je však C # jedinou oficiálně podporovanou volbou .NET."

msgid ""
"GDScript code itself doesn't execute as fast as compiled C# or C++. However, "
"most script code calls functions written with fast algorithms in C++ code "
"inside the engine. In many cases, writing gameplay logic in GDScript, C#, or "
"C++ won't have a significant impact on performance."

"Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to the web "

msgstr ""
"Projekty napsané v C# používající Godot 4 nemohou být momentálně exportovány "
"na webové platformy. Zvažte místo toho použití Godot 3 pro použití C# na "

"You can use any version of the language or mix compiler brands and versions "

"Bridge."

"GDExtension is the best choice for performance. You don't need to use it "

msgstr ""
"Tento jazyk je nejlepší volbou pro výkon a nemusí být používán v celé hře, "
