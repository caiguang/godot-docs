msgid "Enabling navigation debug"
msgstr "\\ ``--debug-navigation``"

msgid ""
"The navigation debug visualizations are enabled by default inside the "
"editor. To visualize navigation meshes and connections at runtime too, "
"enable the option **Visible Navigation** in the editor **Debug** menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot debug builds the navigation debug can also be toggled through the "
"NavigationServer singletons from scripts."

msgid "Navigation debug settings"
msgstr "ナビゲーションモード"

msgid ""
"The appearance of navigation debug can be changed in the ProjectSettings "
"under ``debug/shapes/navigation``. Certain debug features can also be "
"enabled or disabled at will but may require a scene restart to take effect."

msgid "Debug navigation mesh polygons"
msgstr "ポリゴンの作成"

msgid ""
"If ``enable_edge_lines`` is enabled, the edges of navigation mesh polygons "
"will be highlighted. If ``enable_edge_lines_xray`` is also enabled, the "
"edges of navigation meshes will be visible through geometry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``enable_geometry_face_random_color`` is enabled, the color of each "
"navigation mesh face will be mixed with a random color that is itself mixed "
"with the color specified in ``geometry_face_color``."

msgid "Debug edge connections"
msgstr "デバッグメニューオプション"

msgid ""
"When two navigation meshes are connected within ``edge_connection_margin`` "
"distance, the connection is overlaid. The color of the overlay is controlled "
"by ``edge_connection_color``. The connections can be made visible through "
"geometry with ``enable_edge_connections_xray``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Edge connections are only visible when the NavigationServer is active."

msgid "Debug performance"
msgstr "パフォーマンス"

msgid ""
"To measure NavigationServer performance a dedicated monitor exists that can "
"be found within the Editor Debugger under *Debugger->Monitors->Navigation "
"Process*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation Process shows how long the NavigationServer spends updating its "
"internals this update frame in milliseconds. Navigation Process works "
"similar to Process for visual frame rendering and Physics Process for "
"collision and fixed updates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation Process accounts for all updates to **navigation maps**, "
"**navigation regions** and **navigation agents** as well as all the "
"**avoidance calculations** for the update frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation Process does NOT include pathfinding performance cause "
"pathfinding operates on the navigation map data independently from the "
"server process update."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation Process should be in general kept as low and as stable as "
"possible for runtime performance to avoid frame rate issues. Note that since "
"the NavigationServer process update happens in the middle of the physics "
"update an increase in Navigation Process will automatically increase Physics "
"Process by the same amount."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation also provides more detailed statistics about the current "
"navigation related objects and navigation map composition on the "
"NavigationServer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation statistics shown here can not be judged as good or bad for "
"performance as it depends entirely on the project what can be considered as "
"reasonable or horribly excessive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation statistics help with identifying performance bottlenecks that are "
"less obvious because the source might not always have a visible "
"representation. E.g. pathfinding performance issues created by overly "
"detailed navigation meshes with thousand of edges / polygons or problems "
"caused by procedural navigation gone wrong."
