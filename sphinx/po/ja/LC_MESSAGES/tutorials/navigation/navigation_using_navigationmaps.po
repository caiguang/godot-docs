msgid "Using NavigationMaps"
msgstr "ナビゲーションを表示"

msgid ""
"A NavigationMap is an abstract navigation world on the NavigationServer "
"identified by a NavigationServer :ref:`RID<class_RID>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A map can hold and connect a near infinite number of navigation regions with "
"navigation meshes to build the traversable areas of a game world for "
"pathfinding."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A map can contain avoidance agents. Collision avoidance will be calculated "
"based on the agents present in the map."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Different NavigationMaps are completely isolated from each other but "
"navigation regions and avoidance agents can switch between different maps. "
"Switches will become effective on NavigationServer synchronization."

msgid "Default navigation maps"
msgstr "ナビゲーションの作成(-navmesh)"

msgid ""
"By default Godot creates a navigation map for each :ref:"
"`World2D<class_World2D>` and :ref:`World3D<class_World3D>` of the root "
"viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The 2D default navigation map RID can be obtained with ``get_world_2d()."
"get_navigation_map()`` from any :ref:`Node2D<class_Node2D>` inheriting Node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The 3D default navigation map RID can be obtained with ``get_world_3d()."
"get_navigation_map()`` from any :ref:`Node3D<class_Node3D>` inheriting Node."

msgid "Creating new navigation maps"
msgstr "ナビゲーションの作成(-navmesh)"

msgid ""
"The NavigationServer can create and support as many navigation maps as "
"required for specific gameplay. Additional navigation maps are created and "
"handled by using the NavigationServer API directly e.g. to support different "
"avoidance agent or actor locomotion types."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example uses of different navigation maps see :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_different_actor_types` and :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_different_actor_locomotion`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each navigation map individually synchronizes queued changes to its "
"navigation regions and avoidance agents. A navigation map that has not "
"received changes will consume little to no processing time. Navigation "
"regions and avoidance agents can only be part of a single navigation map but "
"they can switch map at any time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A navigation map switch will take effect only after the next "
"NavigationServer synchronization."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is no difference between navigation maps created with the "
"NavigationServer2D API or the NavigationServer3D API."
