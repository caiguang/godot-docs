"Sería excelente que el mundo hablara solo un idioma (It would be great if "
"the world spoke only one language). Unfortunately for us developers, that is "
"not the case. While indie or niche games usually do not need localization, "
"games targeting a more massive market often require localization. Godot "
"offers many tools to make this process more straightforward, so this "
"tutorial is more like a collection of tips and tricks."

"Localization is usually done by specific studios hired for the job. Despite "
"the huge amount of software and file formats available for this, the most "

"process of creating the spreadsheets and importing them is already covered "
"in the :ref:`doc_importing_translations` tutorial. If you haven't read the "
"Importing translations page before, we recommend you give it a read before "
"reading this page."

"The resource remapping system isn't supported for DynamicFonts. To use "
"different fonts depending on the language's script, use the DynamicFont "
"fallback system instead, which lets you define as many fallback fonts as you "
"want."

msgid ""
"The upside of the DynamicFont fallback system is that it works regardless of "

msgid "Converting keys to text"
msgstr "キーをテキストに変換する"

msgid ""
"Some controls, such as :ref:`Button <class_Button>` and :ref:`Label "
"<class_Label>`, will automatically fetch a translation if their text matches "
"a translation key. For example, if a label's text is "
"\"MAIN_SCREEN_GREETING1\" and that key exists in the current translation, "

msgid ""
"This automatic translation behavior may be undesirable in certain cases. For "
"instance, when using a Label to display a player's name, you most likely "
"don't want the player's name to be translated if it matches a translation "
"key. To disable automatic translation on a specific node, disable "
"**Localization > Auto Translate** in the inspector."

"In code, the :ref:`Object.tr() <class_Object_method_tr>` function can be "

"To feature placeholders in your translated strings, use :ref:"
"`doc_gdscript_printf` or the equivalent feature in C#. This lets translators "
"move the location of the placeholder in the string freely, which allows "
"translations to sound more natural. Named placeholders with the ``String."
"format()`` function should be used whenever possible, as they also allow "
"translators to choose the *order* in which placeholders appear:"

msgid ""
"If you're using plain English as source strings (rather than message codes "
"``LIKE_THIS``), you may run into ambiguities when you have to translate the "
"same English string to different strings in certain target languages. You "
"can optionally specify a *translation context* to resolve this ambiguity and "
"allow target languages to use different strings, even though the source "
"string is identical:"

msgid "Pluralization"
msgstr "正規化"

msgid ""
"Most languages require different strings depending on whether an object is "
"in singular or plural form. However, hardcoding the \"is plural\" condition "
"depending on whether there is more than 1 object is not valid in all "
"languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some languages have more than two plural forms, and the rules on the number "
"of objects required for each plural form vary. Godot offers support for "
"*pluralization* so that the target locales can handle this automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pluralization is meant to be used with positive (or zero) integer numbers "
"only. Negative and floating-point values usually represent physical entities "
"for which singular and plural don't clearly apply."

msgid ""
"The same text in different languages can vary greatly in length. For this, "
"make sure to read the tutorial on :ref:`doc_size_and_anchors`, as "
"dynamically adjusting control sizes may help. :ref:`Container "

msgid ""
"To check whether your UI can accommodate translations with longer strings "
"than the original, you can enable *pseudolocalization* in the advanced "
"Project Settings. This will replace all your localizable strings with longer "
"versions of themselves, while also replacing some characters in the original "
"strings with accented versions (while still being readable). Placeholders "
"are kept as-is, so that they keep working when pseudolocalization is enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the string ``Hello world, this is %s!`` becomes ``[Ĥéłłô ŵôŕłd́, "
"ŧh̀íš íš %s!]`` when pseudolocalization is enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While looking strange at first, pseudolocalization has several benefits:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It lets you spot non-localizable strings quickly, so you can go over them "
"and make them localizable (if it makes sense to do so)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It lets you check UI elements that can't fit long strings. Many languages "
"will feature much longer translations than the source text, so it's "
"important to ensure your UI can accommodate longer-than-usual strings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It lets you check whether your font contains all the characters required to "
"support various languages. However, since the goal of pseudolocalization is "
"to keep the original strings readable, it's not an effective test for "
"checking whether a font can support :abbr:`CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)` "
"or right-to-left languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The project settings allow you to tune pseudolocalization behavior, so that "
"you can disable parts of it if desired."

msgid "Bidirectional text and UI Mirroring"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Arabic and Hebrew are written from right to left (except for the numbers and "
