msgstr "シェーダー"

msgid ""
"Sky shaders are a special type of shader used for drawing sky backgrounds "
"and for updating radiance cubemaps which are used for image-based lighting "
"(IBL). Sky shaders only have one processing function, the ``sky()`` function."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "There are three places the sky shader is used."
msgstr "ディテールの使用をコントロールする設定がいくつかあります。"

msgid ""
"First the sky shader is used to draw the sky when you have selected to use a "
"Sky as the background in your scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Second, the sky shader is used to update the radiance cubemap when using the "
"Sky for ambient color or reflections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Third, the sky shader is used to draw the lower res subpasses which can be "
"used in the high-res background or cubemap pass."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In total, this means the sky shader can run up to six times per frame, "
"however, in practice it will be much less than that because the radiance "
"cubemap does not need to be updated every frame, and not all subpasses will "
"be used. You can change the behavior of the shader based on where it is "
"called by checking the ``AT_*_PASS`` booleans. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the sky shader to draw a background, the shader will be called "
"for all non-occluded fragments on the screen. However, for the background's "
"subpasses, the shader will be called for every pixel of the subpass."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the sky shader to update the radiance cubemap, the sky shader "
"will be called for every pixel in the cubemap. On the other hand, the shader "
"will only be called when the radiance cubemap needs to be updated. The "
"radiance cubemap needs to be updated when any of the shader parameters are "
"updated. For example, if ``TIME`` is used in the shader, then the radiance "
"cubemap will update every frame. The following list of changes force an "
"update of the radiance cubemap:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``TIME`` is used."
msgstr ""

msgid "``POSITION`` is used and the camera position changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If any ``LIGHTX_*`` properties are used and any :ref:`DirectionalLight3D "
"<class_DirectionalLight3D>` changes."
msgstr ""

msgid "If any uniform is changed in the shader."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the screen is resized and either of the subpasses are used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Try to avoid updating the radiance cubemap needlessly. If you do need to "
"update the radiance cubemap each frame, make sure your :ref:`Sky process "
"mode <class_Sky_property_process_mode>` is set to :ref:`REALTIME "
"<class_Sky_constant_PROCESS_MODE_REALTIME>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the :ref:`process mode <class_Sky_property_process_mode>` only "
"affects the rendering of the radiance cubemap. The visible sky is always "
"rendered by calling the fragment shader for every pixel. With complex "
"fragment shaders, this can result in a high rendering overhead. If the sky "
"is static (the conditions listed above are met) or changes slowly, running "
"the full fragment shader every frame is not needed. This can be avoided by "
"rendering the full sky into the radiance cubemap, and reading from this "
"cubemap when rendering the visible sky. With a completely static sky, this "
"means that it needs to be rendered only once."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following code renders the full sky into the radiance cubemap and reads "
"from that cubemap for displaying the visible sky:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This way, the complex calculations happen only in the cubemap pass, which "
"can be optimized by setting the sky's :ref:`process mode "
"<class_Sky_property_process_mode>` and the :ref:`radiance size "
"<class_Sky_property_radiance_size>` to get the desired balance between "
"performance and visual fidelity."
msgstr ""

msgid "Render modes"
msgstr "レンダリングモード"

msgid ""
"Subpasses allow you to do more expensive calculations at a lower resolution "
"to speed up your shaders. For example the following code renders clouds at a "
"lower resolution than the rest of the sky:"
