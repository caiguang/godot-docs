"As stated in the :ref:`doc_standard_material_3d`, objects can show reflected "
"and/or diffuse light. Reflection probes are used as a source of reflected "
"*and* ambient light for objects inside their area of influence. They can be "
"used to provide more accurate reflections than :ref:`VoxelGI "
"<doc_using_voxel_gi>` and :ref:`SDFGI <doc_using_sdfgi>` while being fairly "
"cheap on system resources."

msgid "ReflectionProbe properties"
msgstr "反射プローブ(Reflection Probe)"

msgid ""
"**Update Mode:** Controls when the reflection probe updates. **Once** only "
"renders the scene once every time the ReflectionProbe is moved. This makes "
"it much faster to render compared to the **Always** update mode, which "
"forces the probe to re-render everything around it every frame. Leave this "
"property on **Once** (default) unless you need the reflection probe to "
"update every frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Intensity:** The brightness of the reflections and ambient lighting. This "
"usually doesn't need to be changed from its default value of ``1.0``, but "
"you can decrease it ``1.0`` if you find that reflections look too strong."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Max Distance:** Controls the maximum distance used by the "
"ReflectionProbe's internal camera. The distance is always at least equal to "
"the **Extents**, but this can be increased to make objects located outside "
"the extents visible in reflections. *This property does not affect the "
"maximum distance at which the ReflectionProbe itself is visible.*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Extents:** The area that will be affected by the ReflectionProbe's "
"lighting and reflections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Origin Offset:** The origin to use for the internal camera used for "
"reflection probe rendering. This must always be constrained within the "
"**Extents**. If needed, adjust this to prevent the reflection from being "
"obstructed by a solid object located exactly at the center of the "
"ReflectionProbe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Box Projection:** Controls whether parallax correction should be used when "
"rendering the reflection probe. This adjusts the reflection's appearance "
"depending on the camera's position (relative to the reflection probe). This "
"has a small performance cost, but the quality increase is often worth it in "
"box-shaped rooms. Note that this effect doesn't work quite as well in rooms "
"with less regular shapes (such as ellipse-shaped rooms)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Interior:** If enabled, ambient lighting will not be sourced from the "
"environment sky, and the background sky won't be rendered onto the "
"reflection probe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Enable Shadows:** Controls whether real-time light shadows should be "
"rendered within the reflection probe. Enable this to improve reflection "
"quality at the cost of performance. This should be left disabled for "
"reflection probes with the **Always** mode, as it's very expensive to render "
"reflections with shadows every frame. Fully :ref:`baked light "
"<doc_using_lightmap_gi>` shadows are not affected by this setting and will "
"be rendered in the reflection probe regardless."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Cull Mask:** Controls which objects are visible in the reflection. This "
"can be used to improve performance by excluding small objects from the "
"reflection. This can also be used to prevent an object from having self-"
"reflection artifacts in situations where **Origin Offset** can't be used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Mesh LOD Threshold:** The automatic level of detail threshold to use for "
"rendering meshes within the reflection. This only affects meshes that have "
"automatic LODs generated for them. Higher values can improve performance by "
"using less detailed geometry, especially for objects that are far away from "
"the reflection's origin. The visual difference of using less detailed "
"objects is usually not very noticeable during gameplay, especially in rough "
"reflections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Ambient category features several properties to adjust ambient lighting "
"rendered by the ReflectionProbe:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Mode:** If set to **Disabled**, no ambient light is added by the probe. If "
"set to **Environment**, the ambient light color is automatically sampled "
"from the environment sky (if **Interior** is disabled) and the reflection's "
"average color. If set to **Constant Color**, the color specified in the "
"**Color** property is used instead. The **Constant Color** mode can be used "
"as an approximation of area lighting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Color:** The color to use when the ambient light mode is set to **Constant "
"Mode**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Color Energy:** The multiplier to use for the ambient light custom "
"**Color**. This only has an effect when the ambient light mode is **Custom "
"Color**."

msgid "ReflectionProbe blending"
msgstr "反射プローブ(Reflection Probe)"

msgid ""
"To make transitions between reflection sources smoother, Godot supports "
"automatic probe blending:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Up to 4 ReflectionProbes can be blended together at a given location. A "
"ReflectionProbe will also fade out smoothly back to environment lighting "
"when it isn't touching any other ReflectionProbe node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SDFGI and VoxelGI will blend in smoothly with ReflectionProbes if used. This "
"allows placing ReflectionProbes strategically to get more accurate (or fully "
"real-time) reflections where needed, while still having rough reflections "
"available in the VoxelGI or SDFGI's area of influence."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make several ReflectionProbes blend with each other, you need to have "
"part of each ReflectionProbe overlap each other's area. The extents should "
"only overlap as little possible with other reflection probes to improve "
"rendering performance (typically a few units in 3D space)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limitations"
msgstr "制限事項"

msgid ""
"When using the Forward+ renderer, Godot uses a *clustering* approach for "
"reflection probe rendering. As many reflection probes as desired can be "
"added (as long as performance allows). However, there's still a default "
"limit of 512 *clustered elements* that can be present in the current camera "
"view. A clustered element is an omni light, a spot light, a :ref:`decal "
"<doc_using_decals>` or a :ref:`reflection probe <doc_reflection_probes>`. "
"This limit can be increased by adjusting the **Rendering > Limits > Cluster "
"Builder > Max Clustered Elements** advanced project setting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the Forward Mobile backend, only 8 reflection probes can be "
"applied on each individual Mesh *resource*. If there are more reflection "
"probes affecting a single mesh, not all of them will be rendered on the mesh."
