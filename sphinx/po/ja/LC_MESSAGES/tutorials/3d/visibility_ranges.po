"If you only need meshes to become less detailed over distance but don't have "
"manually authored LOD meshes, consider relying on automatic :ref:"
"`doc_mesh_lod` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that automatic mesh LOD and visibility ranges can be used at the same "
"time, even on the same mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid "How it works"
msgstr "どのように機能するか"

msgid ""
"Visibility ranges can be used with any node that inherits from "
"GeometryInstance3D. This means they can be used not only with MeshInstance3D "
"and MultiMeshInstance3D for artist-controlled :abbr:`HLOD (Hierarchical "
"Level of Detail)`, but also GPUParticles3D, CPUParticles3D, Label3D, "
"Sprite3D, AnimatedSprite3D and CSGShape3D."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since visibility ranges are configured on a per-node basis, this makes it "
"possible to use different node types as part of a :abbr:`LOD (Level of "
"Detail)` system. For example, you could display a MeshInstance3D "
"representing a tree when up close, and replace it with a Sprite3D impostor "
"in the distance to improve performance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The benefit of :abbr:`HLOD (Hierarchical Level of Detail)` over a "
"traditional :abbr:`LOD (Level of Detail)` system is its hierarchical nature. "
"A single larger mesh can replace several smaller meshes, so that the number "
"of draw calls can be reduced at a distance, but culling opportunities can be "
"preserved when up close. For example, you can have a group of houses that "
"uses individual MeshInstance3D nodes (one for each house) when up close, but "
"turns into a single MeshInstance3D that represents a less detailed group of "
"houses (or use a MultiMeshInstance3D)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lastly, visibility ranges can also be used to fade certain objects entirely "
"when the camera gets too close or too far. This can be used for gameplay "
"purposes, but also to reduce visual clutter. For example, Label3D nodes can "
"be faded using visibility ranges when they're too far away to be readable or "
"relevant to the player."

"This is a quick-start guide for configuring a basic LOD system. After "
"following this guide, this LOD system will display a SphereMesh when up "
"close and a BoxMesh when the camera is far away enough. A small hysteresis "
"margin is also configured via the **Begin Margin** and **End Margin** "
"properties. This prevents LODs from popping back and forth too quickly when "
"the camera is moving at the \"edge\" of the LOD transition."

msgid ""
"**Begin:** The instance will be hidden when the camera is closer to the "
"instance's *origin* than this value (in 3D units)."

"**Begin Margin:** The hysteresis or alpha fade transition distance to use "

msgid ""
"**End:** The instance will be hidden when the camera is further away from "
"the instance's *origin* than this value (in 3D units)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**End Margin:** The hysteresis or alpha fade transition distance to use for "
"the far-away transition (in 3D units). The behavior of this property depends "
"on **Fade Mode**."

"**Fade Mode:** Controls how the transition between LOD levels should be "

msgid "Fade mode"
msgstr "レンダリングモード"

"``0.0``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the inspector's **Visibility Range** section, there are 3 fade modes to "
"choose from:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** Uses hysteresis to switch between LOD levels instantly. This "
"prevents situations where LOD levels are switched back and forth quickly "
"when the player moves forward and then backward at the LOD transition point. "
"The hystereis distance is determined by **Visibility Range > Begin Margin** "
"and **Visibility Range > End Margin**. This mode provides the best "
"performance as it doesn't force rendering to become transparent during the "
"fade transition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Self:** Uses alpha blending to smoothly fade between LOD levels. The node "
"will fade-out itself when reaching the limits of its own visibility range. "
"The fade transition distance is determined by **Visibility Range > Begin "
"Margin** and **Visibility Range > End Margin**. This mode forces transparent "
"rendering on the object during its fade transition, so it has a performance "
"impact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Dependencies:** Uses alpha blending to smoothly fade between LOD levels. "
"The node will fade-in its dependencies when reaching the limits of its own "
"visibility range. The fade transition distance is determined by **Visibility "
"Range > Begin Margin** and **Visibility Range > End Margin**. This mode "
"forces transparent rendering on the object during its fade transition, so it "
"has a performance impact. This mode is intended for hierarchical LOD systems "
"using :ref:`Visibility parent <doc_visibility_ranges_visibility_parent>`. It "
"acts the same as **Self** if visibility ranges are used to perform non-"
"hierarchical LOD."

msgid "Visibility parent"
msgstr "可視領域矩形(Visibility Rect)"

"The **Visibility Parent** property makes it easier to set up :abbr:`HLOD "

"if its parent is visible given its current visibility range properties."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Despite its name, the **Visibility Parent** property *can* point to a node "
"that is not a parent of the node in the scene tree. However, it is "
"impossible to point **Visibility Parent** towards a child node, as this "
"creates a dependency cycle which is not supported. You will get an error "
"message in the Output panel if a dependency cycle occurs."

"In this example, *BatchOfHouses* is a large mesh designed to represent all "

"example, we only need to configure two things:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set **Visibility Range Begin** to a number greater than `0.0` so that "
"*BatchOfHouses* only appears when far away enough from the camera. Below "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On *House1* to *House4*, assign the **Visibility Parent** property to "
"*BatchOfHouses*."

"This makes it easier to perform further adjustments, as you don't need to "
"adjust the **Visibility Range Begin** of *BatchOfHouses* and **Visibility "
"Range End** of *House1* to *House4*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Fade mode is automatically handled by the **Visibility Parent** property, so "
"that the child nodes only become hidden once the parent node is fully faded "
"out. This is done to minimize visible pop-in. Depending on your :abbr:`HLOD "
"(Hierarchical Level of Detail)` setup, you may want to try both the **Self** "
"and **Dependencies** :ref:`fade modes <doc_visibility_ranges_fade_mode>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Nodes hidden via the **Visible** property are essentially removed from the "
"visibility dependency tree, so dependent instances will not take the hidden "
"node or its ancestors into account."
msgstr ""

"In practice, this means that if the target of the **Visibility Parent** node "

msgid "Configuration tips"
msgstr "構成"

msgid "Use simpler materials at a distance to improve performance"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One way to further improve performance is to use simpler materials for "
"distant LOD meshes. While using LOD meshes will reduce the number of "
"vertices that need to be rendered, the per-pixel shading load for materials "
"remains identical. However, per-pixel shading load is regularly a bottleneck "
"on the GPU in complex 3D scenes. One way to reduce this shading load on the "
"GPU is to use simpler materials when they don't make much of a visual "
"difference."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Performance gains when doing so should be carefully measured, as increasing "
"the number of *unique* materials in a scene has a performance cost on its "
"own. Still, using simpler materials for distant LOD meshes can still result "
"in a net performance gain as a result of the fewer per-pixel calculations "
"required."
msgstr ""

"For example, on the materials used by distant LOD meshes, you can disable "
"expensive material features such as:"

msgstr "インポートされた翻訳の構成"

msgid ""
"Godot currently only supports alpha-based fading for visibility ranges. You "
"can however use dithering instead by using several different materials for "
"different LOD levels."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two advantages to using dithering over alpha blending for LOD "
"transitions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Higher performance, as dithering transparency is faster to render compared "
"to alpha blending."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No visual glitches due to :ref:`transparency sorting issues "
"<doc_3d_rendering_limitations_transparency_sorting>` during LOD transitions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The downside of dithering is that a \"noisy\" pattern is visible during LOD "
"fade transitions. This may not be as noticeable at higher viewport "
"resolutions or when temporal antialiasing is enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, as distance fade in BaseMaterial3D only supports fading up close *or* "
"fading when far away, this setup is best used with only two LODs as part of "
"the setup."
