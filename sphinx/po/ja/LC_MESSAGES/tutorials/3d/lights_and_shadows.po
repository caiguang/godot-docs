"When using the Forward+ renderer, Godot uses a *clustering* approach for "
"real-time lighting. As many lights as desired can be added (as long as "
"performance allows). However, there's still a default limit of 512 "
"*clustered elements* that can be present in the current camera view. A "
"clustered element is an omni light, a spot light, a :ref:`decal "
"<doc_using_decals>` or a :ref:`reflection probe <doc_reflection_probes>`. "

"Builder > Max Clustered Elements** advanced project setting."

"These limits currently cannot be changed."

msgid ""
"When using the Compatibility renderer, up to 8 OmniLights + 8 SpotLights can "

"also be decreased to reduce shader compilation times and improve performance "
"slightly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With all rendering methods, up to 8 DirectionalLights can be visible at a "
"time. However, each additional DirectionalLight with shadows enabled will "
"reduce the effective shadow resolution of each DirectionalLight. This is "

msgid ""
"If the rendering limit is exceeded, lights will start popping in and out "

"on light nodes can help reduce this issue while also improving performance. "
"Splitting your meshes into smaller portions can also help, especially for "
"level geometry (which also improves culling efficiency)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to render more lights than possible in a given rendering "
"backend, consider using :ref:`baked lightmaps <doc_using_lightmap_gi>` with "

msgid ""
"**Note on Appearance Changes**: When enabling shadows on a light, be aware "
"that the light's appearance might change compared to when it's rendered "
"without shadows in the compatibility renderer. Due to limitations with older "
"mobile devices, shadows are implemented using a multi-pass rendering "

"determines the light's angular size in degrees. Increasing this above "
"``0.0`` will make shadows softer at greater distances from the caster, while "

"To compute shadow maps, the scene is rendered (only depth) from an "

msgid ""
"To fix this, a technique named *Parallel Split Shadow Maps* (PSSM) is used. "
"This splits the view frustum in 2 or 4 areas. Each area gets its own shadow "
"map. This allows small areas close to the viewer to have the same shadow "
"resolution as a huge, far-away area. When shadows are enabled for "
"DirectionalLight3D, the default shadow mode is PSSM with 4 splits. In "
"scenarios where an object is large enough to appear in all four splits, it "
"results in increased draw calls. Specifically, such an object will be "
"rendered five times in total: once for each of the four shadow splits and "
"once for the final scene rendering. This can impact performance, "
"understanding this behavior is important for optimizing your scene and "
"managing performance expectations."

"Each split distance is controlled relative to the camera far (or shadow "
"**Max Distance** if greater than ``0.0``). ``0.0`` is the eye position and "
"``1.0`` is where the shadow ends at a distance. Splits are in-between. "
"Default values generally work well, but tweaking the first split a bit is "
"common to give more detail to close objects (like a character in a third-"

"適切に機能しますが、最初のSplitを少し調整することで、近くのオブジェクト(第三"
"者のゲームのキャラクターなど)に精緻さを与えることが一般的です。"

msgid ""
"Always make sure to set a shadow **Max Distance** according to what the "
"scene needs. A lower maximum distance will result in better-looking shadows "
"and better performance, as fewer objects will need to be included in shadow "
"rendering. You can also adjust **Fade Start** to control how aggressive the "
"shadow fade-out should be at a distance. For scenes where the **Max "
"Distance** fully covers the scene at any given camera position, you can "
"increase **Fade Start** to ``1.0`` to prevent the shadow from fading at a "
"distance. This should not be done in scenes where **Max Distance** doesn't "
"fully cover the scene, as the shadow will appear to be suddenly cut off at a "
"distance."
