msgid ""
"In most games it is desirable to, at some point, interrupt the game to do "
"something else, such as taking a break or changing options. Implementing a "
"fine-grained control for what can be paused (and what cannot) is a lot of "
"work, so a simple framework for pausing is provided in Godot."
msgstr ""
"一時停止できるもの(およびできないもの)をきめ細かく制御することは多くの作業で"
"あるため、一時停止のためのシンプルなフレームワークがGodotで提供されています。"

msgid "How pausing works"
msgstr "一時停止の仕組み"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"To pause the game the pause state must be set. This is done by assigning "
"``true`` to the :ref:`SceneTree.paused <class_SceneTree_property_paused>` "
"property:"
msgstr ""
"一時停止モードにするには、一時停止状態を設定する必要があります。これは :ref:"
"`SceneTree.paused <class_SceneTree_property_paused>` プロパティに ``true`` を"
"割り当てることで行われます:"

msgid ""
"Doing this will cause two things. First, 2D and 3D physics will be stopped "
"for all nodes. Second, the behavior of certain nodes will stop or start "
"depending on their process mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The physics servers can be made active while the game is paused by using "
"their ``set_active`` methods."

msgid "Process Modes"
msgstr "処理の順番"

msgid ""
"Each node in Godot has a \"Process Mode\" that defines when it processes. It "
"can be found and changed under a node's :ref:`Node <class_Node>` properties "
"in the inspector."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "You can also alter the property with code:"
msgstr "コードで同じ結果を得ることができます:"

msgid "This is what each mode tells a node to do:"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"**Inherit**: Process depending on the state of the parent, grandparent, etc. "
"The first parent that has a non-Inherit state."
msgstr ""
"**Inherit(継承)**: 親、祖父母などの状態に応じたプロセス。最初の親は非継承状態"
"を持っている。"

msgid ""
"**Pausable**: Process the node (and its children in Inherit mode) only when "
"the game is not paused."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**WhenPaused**: Process the node (and its children in Inherit mode) *only* "
"when the game is paused."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"**Always**: Process the node (and its children in Inherit mode) no matter "
"what. Paused or not, this node will process."
msgstr ""
"**Process(処理)**: 無条件にノードを処理します(Inherit モードのも)。このノード"
"は一時停止中か否かを問わず処理されます。"

msgid ""
"**Disabled**: The node (and its children in Inherit mode) will not process "
"at all."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"By default, all nodes have this property in the \"Inherit\" state. If the "
"parent is set to \"Inherit\", then the grandparent will be checked and so "
"on. If a state can't be found in any of the grandparents, the pause state in "
"SceneTree is used. This means that, by default, when the game is paused "
"every node will be paused. Several things happen when a node stops "
"processing."
msgstr ""
"デフォルトでは、すべてのノードに \"Inherit(継承)\" 状態のこのプロパティがあり"
"ます。つまり、親ノードに設定されている同じプロパティに応じて処理する (または"
"処理しない) ことを意味します。親が \"Inherit\" に設定されている場合、祖父母が"
"チェックされます。最終的に、いずれかの祖先に状態が見つからない場合、SceneTree"
"の一時停止状態が使用されます。これは、デフォルトでは、ゲームが一時停止する"
"と、すべてのノードが一時停止することを意味します。"

msgid ""
"The ``_process``, ``_physics_process``, ``_input``, and ``_input_event`` "
"functions will not be called. However signals still work and cause their "
"connected function to run, even if that function's script is attached to a "
"node that is not currently being processed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Animation nodes will pause their current animation, audio nodes will pause "
"their current audio stream, and particles will pause. These resume "
"automatically when the game is no longer paused."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is important to note that even if a node is processing while the game is "
"paused physics will **NOT** work for it by default. As stated earlier this "
"is because the physics servers are turned off. The physics servers can be "
"made active while the game is paused by using their ``set_active`` methods."

msgid "Pause menu example"
msgstr "シーンを一時停止"

msgid "Start by creating a button that will be used to pause the game."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Create a menu containing a close button, set the **Process Mode** of the "
"menu's root node to **When Paused**, then hide the menu. Since the process "
"mode is set to **When Paused** on the root node, all its children and "
"grandchildren will inherit that process mode. This way, all the nodes in the "
"menu will start processing when the game is paused."
msgstr ""
"一時停止ポップアップのルートを \"Process\" に設定するだけで、すべての子と孫が"
"その状態を継承します。この場合、シーンツリーのこのブランチは、一時停止しても"
"機能し続けます。"

msgid ""
"Attach a script to the menu's root node, connect the pause button created "
"earlier to a new method in the script, and inside that method pause the game "
"and show the pause menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, connect the menu's close button to a new method in the script. "
"Inside that method, unpause the game and hide the pause menu."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "You should now have a working pause menu."
msgstr "これで、[シーン]タブにスプライトノードのみが追加されました。"
