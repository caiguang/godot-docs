"When a generic type parameter is annotated with the ``[MustBeVariant]`` "
"attribute, the generic type is required to be a Variant-compatible type. "
"When the type used is also a generic type, this generic type must be "
"annotated with the ``[MustBeVariant]`` attribute as well. For example, the "
"generic ``Godot.Collections.Array<T>`` type only supports items of a type "
"that can be converted to Variant, a generic type can be specified if it's "
"properly annotated."

msgid ""
"Do not suppress a warning from this rule. API that contains generic type "
"arguments annotated with the ``[MustBeVariant]`` attribute usually has this "
"requirement because the values will be passed to the engine, if the type "
"can't be marshalled it will result in runtime errors."
