"However, version control in the editor requires a plugin for the specific "

"The list of files of folders that should be ignored from version control in "
"Godot 3.x and Godot 4.0 is **entirely** different. This is important, as "
"Godot 3.x and 4.0 may store sensitive credentials in ``export_presets.cfg`` "
"(unlike Godot 4.1 and later)."

"There are some files and folders Godot automatically creates when opening a "
