msgid "Why use HTTP?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`HTTP requests <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP>`_ are "
"useful to communicate with web servers and other non-Godot programs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compared to Godot's other networking features (like :ref:`High-level "
"multiplayer <doc_high_level_multiplayer>`), HTTP requests have more overhead "
"and take more time to get going, so they aren't suited for real-time "
"communication, and aren't great to send lots of small updates as is common "
"for multiplayer gameplay."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"HTTP, however, offers interoperability with external web resources and is "
"great at sending and receiving large amounts of data, for example to "
"transfer files like game assets. These assets can then be loaded using :ref:"
"`runtime file loading and saving <doc_runtime_loading_and_saving>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So HTTP may be useful for your game's login system, lobby browser, to "
"retrieve some information from the web or to download game assets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial assumes some familiarity with Godot and the Godot Editor. "
"Refer to the :ref:`Introduction <toc-learn-introduction>` and the :ref:`Step "
"by step <toc-learn-step_by_step>` tutorial, especially its :ref:`Nodes and "
"Scenes <doc_nodes_and_scenes>` and :ref:`Creating your first script "
"<doc_scripting_first_script>` pages if needed."

msgid "HTTP requests in Godot"
msgstr "Fazendo solicitações HTTP"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` node is the easiest way to make "
"HTTP requests in Godot. It is backed by the more low-level :ref:`HTTPClient "
"<class_HTTPClient>`, for which a tutorial is available :ref:`here "
"<doc_http_client_class>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this example, we will make an HTTP request to GitHub to retrieve the "
"name of the latest Godot release."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When exporting to **Android**, make sure to enable the **Internet** "
"permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or "
"using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be "
"blocked by the Android OS."

msgid "Preparing the scene"
msgstr "Preparando a cena"

msgid ""
"Create a new empty scene, add a root :ref:`Node <class_Node>` and add a "
"script to it. Then add a :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` node as a "
"child."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scripting the request"
msgstr "Iniciando o projeto"

msgid ""
"When the project is started (so in ``_ready()``), we're going to send an "
"HTTP request to Github using our :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` "
"node, and once the request completes, we're going to parse the returned JSON "
"data, look for the ``name`` field and print that to console."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save the script and the scene, and run the project. The name of the most "
"recent Godot release on Github should be printed to the output log. For more "
"information on parsing JSON, see the class references for :ref:`JSON "
"<class_JSON>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that you may want to check whether the ``result`` equals "
"``RESULT_SUCCESS`` and whether a JSON parsing error occurred, see the JSON "
"class reference and :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` for more."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You have to wait for a request to finish before sending another one. Making "
"multiple request at once requires you to have one node per request. A common "
"strategy is to create and delete HTTPRequest nodes at runtime as necessary."

"what if you need to send data to the server? Here is a common way of doing "

msgid "Setting custom HTTP headers"
msgstr "Criando Contêineres personalizados"

msgid ""
"Of course, you can also set custom HTTP headers. These are given as a string "
"array, with each string containing a header in the format ``\"header: "
"value\"``. For example, to set a custom user agent (the HTTP ``User-Agent`` "
"header) you could use the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Be aware that someone might analyse and decompile your released application "
"and thus may gain access to any embedded authorization information like "
"tokens, usernames or passwords. That means it is usually not a good idea to "
"embed things such as database access credentials inside your game. Avoid "
"providing information useful to an attacker whenever possible."
