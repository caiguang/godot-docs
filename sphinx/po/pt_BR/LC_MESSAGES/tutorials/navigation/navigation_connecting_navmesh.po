msgid ""
"Different NavigationMeshes are automatically merged by the NavigationServer "
"when at least two vertex positions of one edge exactly overlap."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To connect over arbitrary distances see :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_using_navigationlinks`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same is true for multiple NavigationPolygon resources. As long as their "
"outline points overlap exactly the NavigationServer will merge them. "
"NavigationPolygon outlines must be from different NavigationPolygon "
"resources to connect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Overlapping or intersecting outlines on the same NavigationPolygon will fail "
"the navigation mesh creation. Overlapping or intersecting outlines from "
"different NavigationPolygons will often fail to create the navigation region "
"edge connections on the NavigationServer and should be avoided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exactly means exactly for the vertex position merge. Small float errors that "
"happen quite regularly with imported meshes will prevent a successful vertex "
"merge."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively navigation meshes are not merged but still considered as "
"**connected** by the NavigationServer when their edges are nearly parallel "
"and within distance to each other. The connection distance is defined by "
"the  ``edge_connection_margin`` for each navigation map. In many cases "
"navigation mesh edges cannot properly connect when they partly overlap. "
"Better avoid any navigation mesh overlap at all time for a consistent merge "
"behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If navigation debug is enabled and the NavigationServer active the "
"established navigation mesh connections will be visualized. See :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_debug_tools` for more info about navigation debug options."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default 2D ``edge_connection_margin`` can be changed in the "
"ProjectSettings under ``navigation/2d/default_edge_connection_margin``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default 3D ``edge_connection_margin`` can be changed in the "
"ProjectSettings under ``navigation/3d/default_edge_connection_margin``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The edge connection margin value of any navigation map can also be changed "
"at runtime with the NavigationServer API."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Changing the edge connection margin will trigger a full update of all "
"navigation mesh connections on the NavigationServer."
