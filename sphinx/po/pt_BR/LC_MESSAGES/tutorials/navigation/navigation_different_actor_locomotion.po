msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To support different actor locomotion like crouching and crawling, a similar "
"map setup as supporting :ref:`doc_navigation_different_actor_types` is "
"required."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bake different navigation meshes with an appropriate height for crouched or "
"crawling actors so they can find paths through those narrow sections in your "
"game world."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an actor changes locomotion state, e.g. stands up, starts crouching or "
"crawling, query the appropriate map for a path."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the avoidance behavior should also change with the locomotion e.g. only "
"avoid while standing or only avoid other agents in the same locomotion "
"state, switch the actors's avoidance agent to another avoidance map with "
"each locomotion change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While a path query can be execute immediately for multiple maps, the "
"avoidance agent map switch will only take effect after the next server "
"synchronization."
