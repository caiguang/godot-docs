msgid "What is a rigid body?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A rigid body is one that is directly controlled by the physics engine in "
"order to simulate the behavior of physical objects. In order to define the "
"shape of the body, it must have one or more :ref:`Shape3D <class_Shape3D>` "
"objects assigned. Note that setting the position of these shapes will affect "
"the body's center of mass."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to control a rigid body"
msgstr "Como controlar um corpo rígido"

msgid ""
"A rigid body's behavior can be altered by setting its properties, such as "
"mass and weight. A physics material needs to be added to the rigid body to "
"adjust its friction and bounce, and set if it's absorbent and/or rough. "
"These properties can be set in the Inspector or via code. See :ref:"
"`RigidBody3D <class_RigidBody3D>` and :ref:`PhysicsMaterial "
"<class_PhysicsMaterial>` for the full list of properties and their effects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are several ways to control a rigid body's movement, depending on your "
"desired application."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you only need to place a rigid body once, for example to set its initial "
"location, you can use the methods provided by the :ref:`Node3D "
"<class_Node3D>` node, such as ``set_global_transform()`` or ``look_at()``. "
"However, these methods cannot be called every frame or the physics engine "
"will not be able to correctly simulate the body's state. As an example, "
"consider a rigid body that you want to rotate so that it points towards "
"another object. A common mistake when implementing this kind of behavior is "
"to use ``look_at()`` every frame, which breaks the physics simulation. "
"Below, we'll demonstrate how to implement this correctly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The fact that you can't use ``set_global_transform()`` or ``look_at()`` "
"methods doesn't mean that you can't have full control of a rigid body. "
"Instead, you can control it by using the ``_integrate_forces()`` callback. "
"In this method, you can add *forces*, apply *impulses*, or set the "
"*velocity* in order to achieve any movement you desire."
msgstr ""

msgid "The \"look at\" method"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As described above, using the Node3D's ``look_at()`` method can't be used "
"each frame to follow a target. Here is a custom ``look_at()`` method called "
"``look_follow()`` that will work with rigid bodies:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method uses the rigid body's ``angular_velocity`` property to rotate "
"the body. The axis to rotate around is given by the cross product between "
"the current forward direction and the direction one wants to look in. The "
"``clamp`` is a simple method used to prevent the amount of rotation from "
"going past the direction which is wanted to be looked in, as the total "
"amount of rotation needed is given by the arccosine of the dot product. This "
"method can be used with ``axis_lock_angular_*`` as well. If more precise "
"control is needed, solutions such as ones relying on :ref:`class_Quaternion` "
"may be required, as discussed in :ref:`doc_using_transforms`."
