msgid "Audio effects"
msgstr "Efeitos de áudio"

msgid ""
"Godot includes several audio effects that can be added to an audio bus to "
"alter every sound file that goes through that bus."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Try them all out to get a sense of how they alter sound. Here follows a "
"short description of the available effects:"
msgstr ""
"Experimente todos pare ter uma noção de como eles alteram o som. Aqui segue "
"uma breve descrição dos efeitos disponíveis:"

msgid "Amplify"
msgstr "Amplificar"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Amplify changes the volume of the signal. Some care needs to be taken, "
"though: setting the level too high can make the sound digitally clip, which "
"can produce unpleasant crackles and pops."
msgstr ""
"Amplificar altera a amplitude do sinal. Alguns cuidados precisam ser "
"tomados. Definir o nível muito alto pode fazer o som clipar, o que "
"geralmente é indesejável."

msgid "BandLimit and BandPass"
msgstr "BandLimit e BandPass"

msgid ""
"These are resonant filters which block frequencies around the *Cutoff* "
"point. BandPass can be used to simulate sound passing through an old "
"telephone line or megaphone. Modulating the BandPass frequency can simulate "
"the sound of a wah-wah guitar pedal, think of the guitar in Jimi Hendrix's "
"*Voodoo Child (Slight Return)*."
msgstr ""
"Estes são filtros ressonantes que bloqueiam freqüências em torno do ponto "
"*Cutoff*. O BandPass pode ser usado para simular som passando por uma linha "
"telefônica antiga ou megafone. A modulação da freqüência do BandPass pode "
"simular o som de um pedal de guitarra wah-wah, pense na guitarra no ponto "
"*Voodoo Child (Slight Return)* de Jimi Hendrix."

msgid "Capture"
msgstr "Captura"

msgid ""
"The Capture effect copies the audio frames of the audio bus that it is on "
"into an internal buffer. This can be used to capture data from the "
"microphone or to transmit audio over the network in real-time."
msgstr ""
"O efeito Capture copia os quadros de áudio do barramento de áudio em que ele "
"está em um buffer interno. Isso pode ser usado para capturar dados do "
"microfone ou para transmitir áudio pela rede em tempo real."

msgid "Chorus"
msgstr "Chorus"

msgid ""
"As the name of the effect implies, the Chorus effect makes a single audio "
"sample sound like an entire chorus. It does this by duplicating a signal and "
"very slightly altering the timing and pitch of each duplicate, and varying "
"that over time via an LFO (low frequency oscillator). The duplicate(s) are "
"then mixed back together with the original signal, producing a lush, wide, "
"and large sound. Although chorus is traditionally used for voices, it can be "
"desirable with almost any type of sound."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compressor"
msgstr "Compressor"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"A dynamic range compressor automatically attenuates (ducks) the level of the "
"incoming signal when its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The level of "
"attenuation applied is proportional to how far the incoming audio exceeds "
"the threshold. The compressor's Ratio parameter controls the degree of "
"attenuation. One of the main uses of a compressor is to reduce the dynamic "
"range of signals with very loud and quiet parts. Reducing the dynamic range "
"of a signal can make it fit more comfortably in a mix."
msgstr ""
"Um compressor de faixa dinâmica atenua automaticamente o nível do sinal de "
"entrada quando sua amplitude excede um certo limite. O nível de atenuação "
"aplicado é proporcional a quanto o áudio de entrada excede o limite. O "
"parâmetro Ratio do compressor controla o grau de atenuação. Um dos "
"principais usos de um compressor é reduzir a faixa dinâmica de sinais com "
"partes muito altas e silenciosas. A redução da faixa dinâmica de um sinal "
"pode facilitar a mixagem."

msgid "The compressor has many uses. For example:"
msgstr "O compressor tem muitos usos. Por exemplo:"

msgid ""
"It can be used in the Master bus to compress the whole output prior to being "
"hit by a limiter, making the effect of the limiter much more subtle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It can be used in voice channels to ensure they sound as even as possible."
msgstr ""
"Ele pode ser usado em canais de voz para garantir que soem o mais uniformes "
"possível."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"It can be *sidechained* by another sound source. This means it can reduce "
"the sound level of one signal using the level of another audio bus for "
"threshold detection. This technique is very common in video game mixing to "
"\"duck\" the level of music or sound effects when in-game or multiplayer "
"voices need to be fully audible."
msgstr ""
"Pode ser encadeado. Isso significa que ele pode reduzir o nível de som de um "
"sinal usando o nível de outro barramento de áudio para detecção de limite. "
"Essa técnica é muito comum na mixagem de videogames para abaixar o nível de "
"música ou efeitos sonoros quando as vozes precisam ser ouvidas."

msgid ""
"It can accentuate transients by using a slower attack. This can make sound "
"effects more punchy."
msgstr ""
"Ele pode acentuar os transientes usando um ataque mais lento. Isso pode "
"tornar os efeitos sonoros mais impactantes."

msgid ""
"If your goal is to prevent a signal from exceeding a given amplitude "
"altogether, rather than to reduce the dynamic range of the signal, a :ref:"
"`limiter <doc_audio_buses_limiter>` is likely a better choice than a "
"compressor for this purpose. However, applying compression before a limiter "
"is still good practice."
msgstr ""

msgid "Delay"
msgstr "Delay"

msgid ""
"Digital delay essentially duplicates a signal and repeats it at a specified "
"speed with a volume level that decays for each repeat. Delay is great for "
"simulating the acoustic space of a canyon or large room, where sound bounces "
"have a lot of *delay* between their repeats. This is in contrast to reverb, "
"which has a more natural and blurred sound to it. Using this in conjunction "
"with reverb can create very natural sounding environments!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Distortion"
msgstr "Distortion"

msgid "Makes the sound distorted. Godot offers several types of distortion:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Overdrive* sounds like a guitar distortion pedal or megaphone. Sounds "
"distorted with this sound like they're coming through a low-quality speaker "
"or device."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Tan* sounds like another interesting flavor of overdrive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Bit crushing* clamps the amplitude of the signal, making it sound flat and "
"crunchy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All three types of distortion can add higher frequency sounds to an original "
"sound, making it stand out better in a mix."
msgstr ""

msgid "EQ"
msgstr "EQ"

msgid ""
"EQ is what all other equalizers inherit from. It can be extended with Custom "
"scripts to create an equalizer with a custom number of bands."
msgstr ""

msgid "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"
msgstr "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"

msgid ""
"Godot provides three equalizers with different numbers of bands, which are "
"represented in the title (6, 10, and 21 bands, respectively). An equalizer "
"on the Master bus can be useful for cutting low and high frequencies that "
"the device's speakers can't reproduce well. For example, phone or tablet "
"speakers usually don't reproduce low frequency sounds well, and could make a "
"limiter or compressor attenuate sounds that aren't even audible to the user "
"anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: The equalizer effect can be disabled when headphones are plugged in, "
"giving the user the best of both worlds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Filter"
msgstr "Filtro"

msgid ""
"Filter is what all other filters inherit from and should not be used "
"directly."
msgstr ""

msgid "HighPassFilter"
msgstr "HighPassFilter"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency. HighPassFilter is used "
"to reduce the bass content of a signal."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "HighShelfFilter"
msgstr "HighShelfFilter"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limiter"
msgstr "Limiter"

msgid ""
"A limiter is similar to a compressor, but it's less flexible and designed to "
"prevent a signal's amplitude exceeding a given dB threshold. Adding a "
"limiter to the final point of the Master bus is good practice, as it offers "
"an easy safeguard against clipping."
msgstr ""

msgid "LowPassFilter"
msgstr "LowPassFilter (Filtro LowPass)"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency and can also resonate "
"(boost frequencies close to the *Cutoff* frequency). Low pass filters can be "
"used to simulate \"muffled\" sound. For instance, underwater sounds, sounds "
"blocked by walls, or distant sounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "LowShelfFilter"
msgstr "LowShelfFilter (Filtro de Prateleira Baixa)"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr ""

msgid "NotchFilter"
msgstr "NotchFilter"

msgid ""
"The opposite of the BandPassFilter, it removes a band of sound from the "
"frequency spectrum at a given *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Panner"
msgstr "Panner"

msgid ""
"The Panner allows the stereo balance of a signal to be adjusted between the "
"left and right channels. Headphones are recommended when configuring in this "
"effect."
msgstr ""

msgid "Phaser"
msgstr "Phaser"

msgid ""
"This effect is formed by de-phasing two duplicates of the same sound so they "
"cancel each other out in an interesting way. Phaser produces a pleasant "
"whooshing sound that moves back and forth through the audio spectrum, and "
"can be a great way to create sci-fi effects or Darth Vader-like voices."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "PitchShift"
msgstr "PitchShift"

msgid ""
"This effect allows the adjustment of the signal's pitch independently of its "
"speed. All frequencies can be increased/decreased with minimal effect on "
"transients. PitchShift can be useful to create unusually high or deep "
"voices. Do note that altering pitch can sound unnatural when pushed outside "
"of a narrow window."
msgstr ""

msgid "Record"
msgstr "Gravação"

msgid "The Record effect allows the user to record sound from a microphone."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reverb"
msgstr "Reverberação"

msgid ""
"Reverb simulates rooms of different sizes. It has adjustable parameters that "
"can be tweaked to obtain the sound of a specific room. Reverb is commonly "
"outputted from :ref:`Area3Ds <class_Area3D>` (see :ref:`Reverb buses "
"<doc_audio_streams_reverb_buses>`), or to apply a \"chamber\" feel to all "
"sounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "SpectrumAnalyzer"
msgstr "Analisador de espectro (SpectrumAnalyzer)"

msgid ""
"This effect doesn't alter audio, instead, you add this effect to buses you "
"want a spectrum analysis of. This would typically be used for audio "
"visualization. Visualizing voices can be a great way to draw attention to "
"them without just increasing their volume. A demo project using this can be "
"found `here <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/"
"audio/spectrum>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid "StereoEnhance"
msgstr "StereoEnhance"

msgid "This effect uses a few algorithms to enhance a signal's stereo width."
