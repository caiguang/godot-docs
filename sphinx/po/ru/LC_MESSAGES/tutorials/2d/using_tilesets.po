"A tilemap is a grid of tiles used to create a game's layout. There are "
"several benefits to using :ref:`TileMap <class_TileMap>` nodes to design "
"your levels. First, they let you draw a layout by \"painting\" tiles onto a "
"grid, which is much faster than placing individual :ref:`Sprite2D "
"<class_Sprite2D>` nodes one by one. Second, they allow for larger levels "
"because they are optimized for drawing large numbers of tiles. Finally, they "
"allow you to add greater functionality to your tiles with collision, "
"occlusion, and navigation shapes."

"Карта тайлов - это сетка тайлов, используемая для создания макета игры. Есть "
"несколько преимуществ использования узлов :ref:`TileMap <class_TileMap>` для "
"разработки ваших уровней. Во-первых, они позволяют рисовать макет путем "
"«рисования» плиток на сетке, что намного быстрее, чем размещение отдельных "
"узлов :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` один за другим. Во-вторых, они позволяют "
"использовать гораздо большие уровни, поскольку оптимизированы для рисования "
"большого количества плиток. Наконец, вы можете добавлять к плиткам формы "
"столкновения, окклюзии и навигации, добавляя дополнительные функциональные "
