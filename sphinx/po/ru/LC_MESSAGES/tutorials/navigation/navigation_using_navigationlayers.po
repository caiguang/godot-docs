"NavigationLayers are an optional feature to further control which navigation "
"meshes are considered in a path query and which regions can be connected. "
"They work similar to how physics layers control collision between collision "
"objects or how visual layers control what is rendered to the Viewport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationLayers can be named in the **ProjectSettings** the same as physics "
"layers or visual layers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If two regions have not a single compatible layer they will not be merged by "
"the NavigationServer. See :ref:`doc_navigation_connecting_navmesh` for more "
"information on merging navigation meshes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a region has not a single compatible navigation layer with the "
"``navigation_layers`` parameter of a path query this regions navigation mesh "
"will be skipped in pathfinding. See :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_using_navigationpaths` for more information on querying the "
"NavigationServer for paths."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationLayers are a single ``int`` value that is used as a **bitmask**. "
"Many navigation related nodes have ``set_navigation_layer_value()`` and "
"``get_navigation_layer_value()`` functions to set and get a layer number "
"directly without the need for more complex bitwise operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In scripts the following helper functions can be used to work with the "
"``navigation_layers`` bitmask."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Changing navigation layers for path queries is a performance friendly "
"alternative to enabling / disabling entire navigation regions. Compared to "
"region changes a navigation path query with different navigation layers does "
"not trigger large scale updates on the NavigationServer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Changing the navigation layers of NavigationAgent nodes will have an "
"immediate effect on the next path query. Changing the navigation layers of "
"regions will have an immediate effect on the region but any new region "
"connect or disconnect will only be in effect after the next physics frame."
