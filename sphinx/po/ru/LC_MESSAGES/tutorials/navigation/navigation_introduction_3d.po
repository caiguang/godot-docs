"Godot provides multiple objects, classes and servers to facilitate grid-"
"based or mesh-based navigation and pathfinding for 2D and 3D games. The "

"``Astar3D`` objects provide an option to find the shortest path in a graph "
"of weighted **points**."

"The AStar3D class is best suited for cell-based 3D gameplay that does not "

"``NavigationServer3D`` provides a powerful server API to find the shortest "
"path between two positions on an area defined by a navigation mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The NavigationServer is best suited for 3D realtime gameplay that does "
"require actors to reach any possible position within a navigation mesh "
"defined area. Mesh-based navigation scales well with large game worlds as a "
"large area can often be defined with a single polygon when it would require "
"many, many grid cells."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The NavigationServer holds different navigation maps that each consist of "
"regions that hold navigation mesh data. Agents can be placed on a map for "
"avoidance calculation. RIDs are used to reference internal maps, regions, "
"and agents when communicating with the server."

msgid ""
"Reference to a specific navigation region that can hold navigation mesh "
