"NavigationLinks are used to connect navigation mesh polygons from :ref:"
"`NavigationRegion2D<class_NavigationRegion2D>` and :ref:"
"`NavigationRegion3D<class_NavigationRegion3D>` over arbitrary distances for "
"pathfinding."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationLinks are also used to consider movement shortcuts in pathfinding "
"available through interacting with gameplay objects e.g. ladders, jump pads "
"or teleports."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2D and 3D versions of NavigationJumplinks nodes are available as :ref:"
"`NavigationLink2D<class_NavigationLink2D>` and :ref:"
"`NavigationLink3D<class_NavigationLink3D>` respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Different NavigationRegions can connect their navigation meshes without the "
"need for a NavigationLink as long as they are within navigation map "
"``edge_connection_margin`` and have compatible ``navigation_layers``. As "
"soon as the distance becomes too large, building valid connections becomes a "
"problem - a problem that NavigationLinks can solve."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :ref:`doc_navigation_using_navigationregions` to learn more about the "
"use of navigation regions. See :ref:`doc_navigation_connecting_navmesh` to "
"learn more about how to connect navigation meshes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationLinks share many properties with NavigationRegions like "
"``navigation_layers``. NavigationLinks add a single connection between two "
"positions over an arbitrary distance compared to NavigationRegions that add "
"a more local traversable area with a navigation mesh resource."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationLinks have a ``start_position`` and ``end_position`` and can go in "
"both directions when ``bidirectional`` is enabled. When placed a "
"navigationlink connects the navigation mesh polygons closest to its "
"``start_position`` and ``end_position`` within search radius for pathfinding."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The polygon search radius can be configured globally in the ProjectSettings "
"under ``navigation/2d_or_3d/default_link_connection_radius`` or set for each "
"navigation **map** individually using the ``NavigationServer."
"map_set_link_connection_radius()`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both ``start_position`` and ``end_position`` have debug markers in the "
"Editor. The visible radius of a position shows the polygon search radius. "
"All navigation mesh polygons inside are compared and the closest is picked "
"for the edge connection. If no valid polygon is found within the search "
"radius the navigation link gets disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The link debug visuals can be changed in the Editor :ref:"
"`ProjectSettings<class_ProjectSettings>` under ``debug/shapes/navigation``. "
"The visibility of the debug can also be controlled in the Editor 3D Viewport "
"gizmo menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationLinks do not move agents between the two link positions by "
"themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A navigation link does not provide any automated movement through the link. "
"Instead, when an agent reaches the position of a link, game code needs to "
"react (e.g. through area triggers) and provide means for the agent to move "
"through the link to end up at the links other position (e.g. through "
"teleport or animation) to continue along the path."
