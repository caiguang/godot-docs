"The properties in this material control how particles behave and change over "
"their lifetime. A lot of them have ``Min``, ``Max``, and ``Curve`` values "
"that allow you to fine-tune their behavior. The relationship between these "
"values is this: When a particle is spawned, the property is set with a "
"random value between ``Min`` and ``Max``. If ``Min`` and ``Max`` are the "
"same, the value will always be the same for every particle. If the ``Curve`` "
"is also set, the value of the property will be multiplied by the value of "
"the curve at the current point in a particle's lifetime. Use the curve to "
"change a property over the particle lifetime. Very complex behavior can be "
