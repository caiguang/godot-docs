msgid "Why fake global illumination?"
msgstr "Qu'est-ce qui fait une bonne documentation ?"

msgid ""
"Godot provides several global illumination (GI) techniques, all with their "
"advantages and drawbacks. Nonetheless, it remains possible to avoid using "
"any GI technique and use a handmade approach instead. There are a few "
"reasons for using a \"handmade\" approach to global illumination instead of "
"VoxelGI, SDFGI or baked lightmaps:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You need to have good rendering performance, but can't afford going through "
"a potentially cumbersome lightmap baking process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You need an approach to GI that is fully real-time *and* works in "
"procedurally generated levels."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You need an approach to GI that is fully real-time *and* does not suffer "
"from significant light leaks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The approaches described below only cover indirect diffuse lighting, not "
"specular lighting. For specular lighting, consider using ReflectionProbes "
"which are usually cheap enough to be used in conjunction with this fake GI "
"approach."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Not sure if faking global illumination with lights is suited to your needs? "
"See :ref:`doc_introduction_to_global_illumination_comparison` for a "
"comparison of GI techniques available in Godot 4."
msgstr ""

msgid "Faking DirectionalLight3D global illumination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While the sky provides its own directional lighting, the scene's main "
"DirectionalLight3D node typically emits a large amount of light. When using "
"a GI technique, this light would be reflected on solid surfaces and would "
"bounce back on most outdoors shaded surfaces."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"We can fake this by adding a second DirectionalLight3D node with the "
"following changes:"
msgstr ""
"Nous pouvons aussi le voir visuellement en ajoutant le deuxième vecteur à la "
"fin du premier :"

msgid ""
"Rotate the light by 180 degrees. This allows it to represent lighting "
"bounced by the main DirectionalLight3D node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set **Shadows** to **Off**. This reduces the secondary light's performance "
"burden while also allowing shaded areas to receive *some* lighting (which is "
"what we want here)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set **Energy** to 10-40% of the original value. There is no \"perfect\" "
"value, so experiment with various energy values depending on the light and "
"your typical material colors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set **Specular** to ``0.0``. Indirect lighting shouldn't emit visible "
"specular lobes, so we need to disable specular lighting entirely for the "
"secondary light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This approach works best in scenes that are mostly outdoors. When going "
"indoors, the secondary DirectionalLight3D's light will still be visible as "
"this light has shadows disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can be worked around by smoothly decreasing the secondary "
"DirectionalLight3D's energy when entering an indoor area (and doing the "
"opposite when leaving the indoor area). For instance, this can be achieved "
"using an Area3D node and AnimationPlayer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Faking positional light global illumination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's possible to follow the same approach as DirectionalLight3D for "
"positional lights (OmniLight3D and SpotLight3D). However, this will require "
"more manual work as this operation needs to be repeated for every positional "
"light node in the scene to look good."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In an ideal scenario, additional OmniLight3Ds should be added at every "
"location where a significant amount of light hits a bright enough surface. "
"However, due to time constraints, this isn't always easily feasible "
"(especially when performing procedural level generation)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're in a hurry, you can place a secondary OmniLight3D node at the same "
"position as the main OmniLight3D node. You can add this node as a child of "
"the main OmniLight3D node to make it easy to move and hide both nodes at the "
"same time."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the secondary OmniLight3D node, perform the following changes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Increase the light's **Range** by 25-50%. This allows the secondary light to "
"lighten what was previously not lit by the original light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set **Energy** to 10-40% of the original value. There is no \"perfect\" "
"value, so experiment with various energy values depending on the light and "
"its surroundings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set **Specular** to 0. Indirect lighting shouldn't emit visible specular "
"lobes, so we need to disable specular lighting entirely for the secondary "
"light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For SpotLight3D, the same trick can be used. In this case, the secondary "
"OmniLight3D should be placed in a way that reflects where *most* light will "
"be bounced. This is usually close to the SpotLight3D's primary impact "
"location."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the example below, a SpotLight3D node is used to light up the room's "
"floor. However, since there is no indirect lighting, the rest of the room "
"remains entirely dark. In real life, the room's walls and ceiling would be "
"lit up by light bouncing around. Using an OmniLight3D node positioned "
"between the SpotLight3D's origin and the floor allows simulating this effect:"
