"WAV files use raw data or light compression (IMA-ADPCM). They are "
"lightweight on the CPU to play back (hundreds of simultaneous voices in this "
"format are fine). The downside is that they take up a lot of disk space."
msgstr ""
"Les fichiers WAV utilisent des données brutes ou une compression légère (IMA-"
"ADPCM). Ils sont légers à lire pour le CPU (des centaines de voix "
"simultanées dans ce format conviennent). L'inconvénient est qu'ils prennent "
"beaucoup d'espace disque."

msgid ""
"Ogg Vorbis files use a stronger compression that results in much smaller "
"file size, but require significantly more processing power to play back."
msgstr ""
"Les fichiers Ogg Vorbis utilisent une compression plus forte qui se traduit "
"par une taille de fichier beaucoup plus petite, mais nécessitent beaucoup "
"plus de puissance de traitement pour la lecture."

msgid ""
"MP3 files use better compression than WAV with IMA-ADPCM, but worse than Ogg "
"Vorbis. This means that a MP3 file with roughly equal quality to Ogg Vorbis "
"will be significantly larger. On the bright side, MP3 requires less CPU "
"usage to play back compared to Ogg Vorbis."
msgstr ""
"Les fichiers MP3 utilisent une meilleure compression que wav avec IMA-ADPCM, "
"mais pire qu’Ogg Vorbis. Cela signifie qu’un fichier MP3 avec une qualité à "
"peu près égale à Ogg Vorbis sera significativement plus grand. Sur le bon "
"côté des choses, mp3 nécessite moins d’utilisation CPU pour jouer en arrière "
"par rapport à Ogg Vorbis. Cela rend MP3 utile pour les projets mobiles et "
"HTML5 où les ressources CPU sont limitées, en particulier lorsque vous jouez "
