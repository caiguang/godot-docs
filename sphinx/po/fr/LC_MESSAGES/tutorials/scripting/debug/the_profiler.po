msgid ""
"You run your game from Godot and play around. It's fun, it's becoming "
"feature complete, and you feel it's getting close to release."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But then, you open the skill tree, and it grinds to a halt as something "
"snags in your code. Watching the skill tree scroll by like it's a slide show "
"is unacceptable. What went wrong? Is it positioning the skill tree elements, "
"the UI, or rendering?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You could try to optimize everything and run the game repeatedly, but you "
"can be smarter about this and narrow down the possibilities. Enter Godot's "
"profiler."

msgid "An overview of the profiler"
msgstr "Vue d'ensemble des fichiers PCK"

msgid ""
"You can open the profiler by opening the **Debugger** panel and clicking on "
"the **Profiler** tab."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot's profiler does not automatically run because profiling is performance-"
"intensive. It has to continually measure everything happening in the game "
"and report back to the debugger, so it's off by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To begin profiling, click on the **Start** button in the top-left. Run your "
"game and data will start appearing. You can also start profiling at any time "
"before or during gameplay, depending on if you want."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The profiler does not currently support C# scripts. C# scripts can be "
"profiled using JetBrains Rider and JetBrains dotTrace with the Godot support "
"plugin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can clear the data by clicking the **Clear** button anytime. Use the "
"**Measure** drop-down menu to change the type of data you measure. The "
"measurements panel and the graph will update accordingly."

msgid "The measured data"
msgstr "La piste de sprite"

msgid ""
"The profiler's interface is split into two. There is a list of functions on "
"the left and the performance graph on the right."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The main measurements are frame time, physics frame, idle time, and physics "
"time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **frame time** is the time it takes Godot to execute all the logic for "
"an entire image, from physics to rendering."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Physics frame** is the time Godot has allocated between physics updates. "
"In an ideal scenario, the frame time is whatever you chose: 16.66 "
"milliseconds by default, which corresponds to 60FPS. It's a frame of "
"reference you can use for everything else around it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Idle time** is the time Godot took to update logic other than physics, "
"such as code that lives in `_process` or timers and cameras set to update on "
"**Idle**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Physics time** is the time Godot took to update physics tasks, like "
"`_physics_process` and built-in nodes set to **Physics** update."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Godot 3, **Frame Time** includes rendering time. Say you find a "
"mysterious spike of lag in your game, but your physics and scripts are all "
"running fast. The delay could be due to the appearance of particles or "
"visual effects!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Godot ticks on Frame Time and Physics Time. This gives you an "
"overview of how long each frame takes relative to the allocated desired "
"physics FPS. You can toggle functions on and off by clicking the checkboxes "
"on the left. Other facilities make appearances as you go down the list, like "
"Physics 2D, Physics, and Audio, before reaching Script functions, where your "
"code appears."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you click on the graph, you change which frame's information appears on "
"the left. In the top right, there is also a frame counter where you can "
"manually adjust the frame you are looking at more granularly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scope of measurement and measurement windows"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can change what measurement you are looking at using the **Measure** "
"drop-down menu. By default, it starts with Frame Time and lists the time it "
"takes to go through the frame in milliseconds. The average time is the "
"average time any given function took when called more than once. For "
"example, a function that took 0.05 milliseconds to run five times should "
"give you an average of 0.01 milliseconds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If accurate milliseconds count is not important, and you want to see "
"proportions of time relative to the rest of the frame, use percentage "
"measurements. Frame % is relative to Frame Time, and Physics % is relative "
"to Physics Time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last option is the scope of the time. **Inclusive** measures the time a "
"function took **with** any nested function calls. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`get_neighbors`, `find_nearest_neighbor` and `move_subject` all took a lot "
"of time. You could be fooled into thinking that this is because all three of "
"them are slow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But when changed to **Self**, Godot measures the time spent in the function "
"body without considering function calls it made itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can see that `get_neighbors` and `move_subject` have lost a lot of their "
"importance. In effect, that means that `get_neighbors` and `move_subject` "
"have spent more time waiting for some other function call to finish than "
"not, and `find_nearest_neighbor` is **actually** slow."

msgid "Debugging slow code with the profiler"
msgstr "Débogage du projet"

msgid ""
"Finding slow code with the profiler boils down to running your game and "
"watching the performance graph as it draws. When an unacceptable spike "
"occurs in the frame time, you can click on the graph to pause your game and "
"narrow the _Frame #_ to the spike's start. You may need to jump back and "
"forth between frames and functions to find the root cause."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Under the Script functions, turn on the checkboxes for some functions to "
"find which take time. These are the functions you need to review and "
"optimize."
msgstr ""

msgid "Measuring manually in microseconds"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your function is complex, it could be challenging to figure out which "
"part needs optimization. Is it your math or the way you access other pieces "
"of data to do the math with? Is it the `for` loop? The `if` statements?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can narrow down the measurement by manually counting ticks as the code "
"runs with some temporary functions. The two functions are part of the `Time` "
"class object. They are `get_ticks_msec` and `get_ticks_usec`. The first "
"measures in milliseconds (1,000 per second), and the second measures in "
"microseconds (1,000,000 per second)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Either one returns the amount of time since the game engine started in their "
"respective time frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you wrap a piece of code with a start and end count of microseconds, the "
"difference between the two is the amount of time it took to run that piece "
"of code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you become a more experienced programmer, this technique becomes less "
"necessary. You begin to learn what parts of a running program are slow. "
"Knowing that loops and branches can be slow comes from experience, and you "
"gain experience by measuring and doing research."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But between the profiler and the ticks functions, you should have enough to "
"get started finding which parts of your code need optimization."
