msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A typical example for different area access in gameplay are doors that "
"connect rooms with different navigation meshes and are not accessible by all "
"actors all the time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a NavigationRegion at the door position. Add an appropriate navigation "
"mesh the size of the door that can connect with the surrounding navigation "
"meshes. In order to control access, enable / disable navigation layer bits "
"so path queries that use the same navigation layer bits can find a path "
"through the \"door\" navigation mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The bitmask can act as a set of door keys or abilities and only actors with "
"at least one matching and enabled bit layer in their pathfinding query will "
"find a path through this region. See :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_advanced_using_navigationlayers` for more information on how "
"to work with navigation layers and the bitmask."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The entire \"door\" region can also be enabled / disable if required but if "
"disabled will block access for all path queries."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prefer working with navigation layers in path queries whenever possible as "
"enabling or disabling navigation layers on a region triggers a costly "
"recalculation of the navigation map connections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Changing navigation layers will only affect new path queries but not "
"automatically update existing paths."
