"Godot ofrece tres opciones para importar sus datos de audio: WAV, Ogg Vorbis "

msgid "Each format has different advantages:"
msgstr "Cada formato posee distintas ventajas:"

msgid ""
"WAV files use raw data or light compression (IMA-ADPCM). They are "
"lightweight on the CPU to play back (hundreds of simultaneous voices in this "
"format are fine). The downside is that they take up a lot of disk space."
msgstr ""
"Los archivos WAV usan datos sin formato o compresión ligera (IMA-ADPCM), "
"requieren una pequeña cantidad de CPU para reproducirse (este formato es "
"bueno para cientos de voces simultáneas), pero ocupan un espacio "
"significativo."

msgid ""
"Ogg Vorbis files use a stronger compression that results in much smaller "
"file size, but require significantly more processing power to play back."
msgstr ""
"Los archivos Ogg Vorbis usan una mayor compresión lo que resulta en un "
"tamaño de archivo mucho más pequeño, pero requieren mucha más potencia de "

msgid ""
"MP3 files use better compression than WAV with IMA-ADPCM, but worse than Ogg "
"Vorbis. This means that a MP3 file with roughly equal quality to Ogg Vorbis "
"will be significantly larger. On the bright side, MP3 requires less CPU "
"usage to play back compared to Ogg Vorbis."
msgstr ""
"Los archivos MP3 utilizan una mejor compresión que WAV con IMA-ADPCM, pero "
"peor que Ogg Vorbis. Esto significa que un archivo MP3 con una calidad "
"aproximadamente igual a la de Ogg Vorbis será significativamente más grande. "
"En el lado positivo, MP3 requiere menos uso de CPU para reproducirse en "
"comparación con Ogg Vorbis. Esto hace que MP3 sea útil para proyectos mobile "
"y HTML5 donde los recursos de la CPU son limitados, especialmente cuando se "
"reproducen varios sonidos comprimidos al mismo tiempo (como sonidos "
"ambientales largos)."
