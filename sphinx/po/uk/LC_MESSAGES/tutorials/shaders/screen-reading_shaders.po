msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Вступ"

msgid ""
"It is often desired to make a shader that reads from the same screen to "
"which it's writing. 3D APIs, such as OpenGL or DirectX, make this very "
"difficult because of internal hardware limitations. GPUs are extremely "
"parallel, so reading and writing causes all sorts of cache and coherency "
"problems. As a result, not even the most modern hardware supports this "
"properly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The workaround is to make a copy of the screen, or a part of the screen, to "
"a back-buffer and then read from it while drawing. Godot provides a few "
"tools that make this process easy."

msgid "Screen texture"
msgstr "Читання текстур"

msgid ""
"Godot :ref:`doc_shading_language` has a special texture to access the "
"already rendered contents of the screen. It is used by specifying a hint "
"when declaring a ``sampler2D`` uniform: ``hint_screen_texture``. A special "
"built-in varying ``SCREEN_UV`` can be used to obtain the UV relative to the "
"screen for the current fragment. As a result, this canvas_item fragment "
"shader results in an invisible object, because it only shows what lies "
"behind:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``textureLod`` is used here as we only want to read from the bottom mipmap. "
"If you want to read from a blurred version of the texture instead, you can "
"increase the third argument to ``textureLod`` and change the hint "
"``filter_nearest`` to ``filter_nearest_mipmap`` (or any other filter with "
"mipmaps enabled). If using a filter with mipmaps, Godot will automatically "
"calculate the blurred texture for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the filter mode is not changed to a filter mode that contains ``mipmap`` "
"in its name, ``textureLod`` with a LOD parameter greater than ``0.0`` will "
"have the same appearance as with the ``0.0`` LOD parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Screen texture example"
msgstr "Приклад текстури екрана"

msgid ""
"The screen texture can be used for many things. There is a special demo for "
"*Screen Space Shaders*, that you can download to see and learn. One example "
"is a simple shader to adjust brightness, contrast and saturation:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Behind the scenes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While this seems magical, it's not. In 2D, when ``hint_screen_texture`` is "
"first found in a node that is about to be drawn, Godot does a full-screen "
"copy to a back-buffer. Subsequent nodes that use it in shaders will not have "
"the screen copied for them, because this ends up being inefficient. In 3D, "
"the screen is copied after the opaque geometry pass, but before the "
"transparent geometry pass, so transparent objects will not be captured in "
"the screen texture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, in 2D, if shaders that use ``hint_screen_texture`` overlap, the "
"second one will not use the result of the first one, resulting in unexpected "
"visuals:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the above image, the second sphere (top right) is using the same source "
"for the screen texture as the first one below, so the first one "
"\"disappears\", or is not visible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In 2D, this can be corrected via the :ref:`BackBufferCopy "
"<class_BackBufferCopy>` node, which can be instantiated between both "
"spheres. BackBufferCopy can work by either specifying a screen region or the "
"whole screen:"
msgstr ""

msgid "With correct back-buffer copying, the two spheres blend correctly:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In 3D, materials that use ``hint_screen_texture`` are considered transparent "
"themselves and will not appear in the resulting screen texture of other "
"materials. If you plan to instance a scene that uses a material with "
"``hint_screen_texture``, you will need to use a BackBufferCopy node."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In 3D, there is less flexibility to solve this particular issue because the "
"screen texture is only captured once. Be careful when using the screen "
"texture in 3D as it won't capture transparent objects and may capture some "
"opaque objects that are in front of the object using the screen texture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can reproduce the back-buffer logic in 3D by creating a :ref:`Viewport "
"<class_Viewport>` with a camera in the same position as your object, and "
"then use the :ref:`Viewport's <class_Viewport>` texture instead of the "
"screen texture."
msgstr ""

msgid "Back-buffer logic"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So, to make it clearer, here's how the backbuffer copying logic works in 2D "
"in Godot:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a node uses ``hint_screen_texture``, the entire screen is copied to the "
"back buffer before drawing that node. This only happens the first time; "
"subsequent nodes do not trigger this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a BackBufferCopy node was processed before the situation in the point "
"above (even if ``hint_screen_texture`` was not used), the behavior described "
"in the point above does not happen. In other words, automatic copying of the "
"entire screen only happens if ``hint_screen_texture`` is used in a node for "
"the first time and no BackBufferCopy node (not disabled) was found before in "
"tree-order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"BackBufferCopy can copy either the entire screen or a region. If set to only "
"a region (not the whole screen) and your shader uses pixels not in the "
"region copied, the result of that read is undefined (most likely garbage "
"from previous frames). In other words, it's possible to use BackBufferCopy "
"to copy back a region of the screen and then read the screen texture from a "
"different region. Avoid this behavior!"

msgid "Depth texture"
msgstr "Імпортування зображень"

msgid ""
"For 3D shaders, it's also possible to access the screen depth buffer. For "
"this, the ``hint_depth_texture`` hint is used. This texture is not linear; "
"it must be converted using the inverse projection matrix."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following code retrieves the 3D position below the pixel being drawn:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Normal-roughness texture"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normal-roughness texture is only supported in the Forward+ rendering method, "
"not Mobile or Compatibility."
msgstr ""
"Текстури з нормальною шорсткістю підтримуються лише у методі рендерингу "
"Forward+, але не в мобільному або сумісності."

msgid ""
"Similarly, the normal-roughness texture can be used to read the normals and "
"roughness of objects rendered in the depth prepass. The normal is stored in "
"the ``.xyz`` channels (mapped to the 0-1 range) while the roughness is "
"stored in the ``.w`` channel."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Redefining screen textures"
msgstr "Читання текстур"

msgid ""
"The screen texture hints (``hint_screen_texture``, ``hint_depth_texture``, "
"and ``hint_normal_roughness_texture``) can be used with multiple uniforms. "
"For example, you may want to read from the texture multiple times with a "
"different repeat flag or filter flag."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following example shows a shader that reads the screen space normal with "
"linear filtering, but reads the screen space roughness using nearest "
"neighbor filtering."

msgstr "Стан перекладу"
