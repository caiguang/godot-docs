msgid "Using VisualShaders"

msgid "VisualShaders are the visual alternative for creating shaders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As shaders are inherently linked to visuals, the graph-based approach with "
"previews of textures, materials, etc. offers a lot of additional convenience "
"compared to purely script-based shaders. On the other hand, VisualShaders do "
"not expose all features of the shader script and using both in parallel "
"might be necessary for specific effects."

msgid ""
"If you are not familiar with shaders, start by reading :ref:"

msgid "Creating a VisualShader"
msgstr "Як створити проєкт"

msgid ""
"VisualShaders can be created in any :ref:`class_ShaderMaterial`. To begin "
"using VisualShaders, create a new ``ShaderMaterial`` in an object of your "
"choice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then assign a :ref:`class_VisualShader` resource to the ``Shader`` property."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Click on the new ``Shader`` resource and the Create Shader dialog will open "
"automatically. Change the Type option to VisualShader in the dropdown."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The layout of the Visual Shader Editor comprises two parts: the upper "
"toolbar and the graph itself."
msgstr ""

msgid "From left to right in the toolbar:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Add Node`` button displays a popup menu to let you add nodes to the "
"shader graph."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The drop-down menu is the shader type: Vertex, Fragment and Light. Like for "
"script shaders, it defines what built-in nodes will be available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following buttons and number input control the zooming level, grid "
"snapping and distance between grid lines (in pixels)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last icon shows the generated shader code corresponding to your graph."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although VisualShaders do not require coding, they share the same logic with "
"script shaders. It is advised to learn the basics of both to have a good "
"understanding of the shading pipeline."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The visual shader graph is converted to a script shader behind the scene, "
"and you can see this code by pressing the last button in the toolbar. This "
"can be convenient to understand what a given node does and how to reproduce "
"it in scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the Visual Shader Editor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, every new ``VisualShader`` will have an output node. Every node "
"connection ends at one of the output node's sockets. A node is the basic "
"unit to create your shader. To add a new node, click on the ``Add Node`` "
"button on the upper left corner or right click on any empty location in the "
"graph, and a menu will pop up."
msgstr ""

msgid "This popup has the following properties:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you right-click on the graph, this menu will be called at the cursor "
"position and the created node, in that case, will also be placed under that "
"position; otherwise, it will be created at the graph's center."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It can be resized horizontally and vertically allowing more content to be "
"shown. Size transform and tree content position are saved between the calls, "
"so if you suddenly closed the popup you can easily restore its previous "
"state."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Expand All`` and ``Collapse All`` options in the drop-down option menu "
"can be used to easily list the available nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also drag and drop nodes from the popup onto the graph."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While the popup has nodes sorted in categories, it can seem overwhelming at "
"first. Try to add some of the nodes, plug them in the output socket and "
"observe what happens."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When connecting any ``scalar`` output to a ``vector`` input, all components "
"of the vector will take the value of the scalar."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When connecting any ``vector`` output to a ``scalar`` input, the value of "
"the scalar will be the average of the vector's components."

"The ``Expression`` node allows you to write Godot Shading Language (GLSL-"
"like) expressions inside your visual shaders. The node has buttons to add "
"any amount of required input and output ports and can be resized. You can "
"also set up the name and type of each port. The expression you have entered "
"will apply immediately to the material (once the focus leaves the expression "
"text box). Any parsing or compilation errors will be printed to the Output "
"tab. The outputs are initialized to their zero value by default. The node is "

msgid "If node"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``If`` node allows you to setup a vector which will be returned the "
"result of the comparison between ``a`` and ``b``. There are three vectors "
"which can be returned: ``a == b`` (in that case the tolerance parameter is "
"provided as a comparison threshold – by default it is equal to the minimal "
