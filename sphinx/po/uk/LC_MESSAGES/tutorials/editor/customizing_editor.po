"You may want to save and load a dock configuration depending on the kind of "

msgid ""
"**Interface > Editor > Editor Language:** Controls the language the editor "

"change this to English so that menu names are identical to names referred to "
"by tutorials. The language can also be changed in the top-right corner of "
"the project manager."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Interface > Editor > Display Scale:** Controls how large UI elements "
"display on screen. The default **Auto** setting finds a suitable value based "
"on your display's DPI and resolution. Due to engine limitations, it only "
"takes the display-provided scaling factor on macOS, not on Windows or Linux."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Interface > Editor > Single Window Mode:** If enabled, this forces the "
"editor to use a single window. This disables certain features such as "
"splitting the script/shaders editor to their own window. Single-window mode "
"can be more stable, especially on Linux when using Wayland."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Interface > Theme > Preset:** The editor theme preset to use. The "
"**Light** theme preset may be easier to read if you're outdoors or in a room "
"with sunlight. The **Black (OLED)** preset can reduce power consumption on "
"OLED displays, which are increasingly common in laptops and phones/tablets."

"folder path that will be automatically scanned for projects in the project "
"manager every time it starts."

"location where new projects are created in the project manager."

"**Editors > 3D > Emulate Numpad:** This allows using the top row 0-9 keys in "
