msgid "Using Pyston for faster development"

"You can use `Pyston <https://www.pyston.org/>`__ to run SCons. Pyston is a "
"JIT-enabled implementation of the Python language (which SCons is written "
"in). Its \"full\" version is currently only compatible with Linux, but "
"Pyston-lite is also compatible with macOS (both x86 and ARM). Pyston can "
"speed up incremental builds significantly, often by a factor between 1.5× "

"to get even faster builds."

"To install Pyston-lite, run ``python -m pip install pyston_lite_autoload`` "
