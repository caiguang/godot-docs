"Godot is a primarily C++ project and it :ref:`uses the SCons build system. "
"<doc_faq_why_scons>` We love SCons for how maintainable and easy to set up "
"it makes our buildsystem. And thanks to that compiling Godot from source can "
"be as simple as running::"

"This produces an *export template* for your current platform, operating "
"system, and architecture. An export template is a build of the engine that "
"is used for running exported projects. To build the *editor* instead you can "
"run the following command::"

"If you plan to debug or develop the engine, then you might want to add "
"another option to the command::"

"Following sections in the article will explain these and other universal "
"options in more detail. But before you can compile Godot, you need to "
"install a few prerequisites. Please refer to the platform documentation to "

msgid "Using multi-threading"
msgstr "Використання кількох потоків"

msgid ""
"The build process may take a while, depending on how powerful your system "
"is. By default, Godot's SCons setup is configured to use all CPU threads but "
"one (to keep the system responsive during compilation). If you want to "
"adjust how many CPU threads SCons will use, use the ``-j <threads>`` "
"parameter to specify how many threads will be used for the build."

msgid "Example for using 4 threads::"
msgstr "Приклад використання 4-х ниток::"

msgid "Platform selection"
msgstr "Вибір платформи"

msgid ""
"Godot's build system will begin by detecting the platforms it can build for. "
"If not detected, the platform will simply not appear on the list of "
"available platforms. The build requirements for each platform are described "
"in the rest of this tutorial section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SCons is invoked by just calling ``scons``. If no platform is specified, "
"SCons will detect the target platform automatically based on the host "
"platform. It will then start building for the target platform right away."
msgstr ""

msgid "To list the available target platforms, use ``scons platform=list``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To build for a platform (for example, ``linuxbsd``), run with the "
"``platform=`` (or ``p=`` to make it short) argument:"

msgid "Resulting binary"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The resulting binaries will be placed in the ``bin/`` subdirectory, "
"generally with this naming convention::"
msgstr ""

msgid "For the previous build attempt, the result would look like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that the binary is for Linux *or* \\*BSD (*not* both), is not "
"optimized, has the whole editor compiled in, and is meant for 64 bits."
msgstr ""

msgid "A Windows binary with the same configuration will look like this:"
msgstr "Врешті при запуску сцени має відтворюватися приблизно така анімація:"

msgid ""
"Copy that binary to any location you like, as it contains the Project "
"Manager, editor and all means to execute the game. However, it lacks the "
"data to export it to the different platforms. For that the export templates "
"are needed (which can be either downloaded from `godotengine.org <https://"
"godotengine.org/>`__, or you can build them yourself)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Aside from that, there are a few standard options that can be set in all "
"build targets, and which will be explained below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Target"
msgstr "Призначення"

msgid ""
"Target controls if the editor is contained and debug flags are used. All "
"builds are optimized. Each mode means:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``target=editor``: Build with editor, optimized, with debugging code "
"(defines: ``TOOLS_ENABLED``, ``DEBUG_ENABLED``, ``-O2``/``/O2``)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``target=template_debug``: Build with C++ debugging symbols (defines: "
"``DEBUG_ENABLED``, ``-O2``/``/O2``)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``target=template_release``: Build without symbols (defines: ``-O3``/``/O2``)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The editor is enabled by default in all PC targets (Linux, Windows, macOS), "
"disabled for everything else. Disabling the editor produces a binary that "
"can run projects but does not include the editor or the Project Manager."

msgid "Development and production aliases"
msgstr "Розробка"

msgid ""
"When creating builds for development (running debugging/:ref:`profiling "
"<doc_using_cpp_profilers>` tools), you often have different goals compared "
"to production builds (making binaries as fast and small as possible)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Godot provides two aliases for this purpose:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``dev_mode=yes`` is an alias for ``verbose=yes warnings=extra werror=yes "
"tests=yes``. This enables warnings-as-errors behavior (similar to Godot's "
"continuous integration setup) and also builds :ref:`unit tests "
"<doc_unit_testing>` so you can run them locally."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``production=yes`` is an alias for ``use_static_cpp=yes debug_symbols=no "
"lto=auto``. Statically linking libstdc++ allows for better binary "
"portability when compiling for Linux. This alias also enables link-time "
"optimization when compiling for Linux, Web and Windows with MinGW, but keeps "
"LTO disabled when compiling for macOS, iOS or Windows with MSVC. This is "
"because LTO on those platforms is very slow to link or has issues with the "
"generated code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can manually override options from those aliases by specifying them on "
"the same command line with different values. For example, you can use "
"``scons production=yes debug_symbols=yes`` to create production-optimized "
"binaries with debugging symbols included."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dev build"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``dev_build`` should **not** be confused with ``dev_mode``, which is an "
"alias for several development-related options (see above)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When doing engine development the ``dev_build`` option can be used together "
"with ``target`` to enable dev-specific code. ``dev_build`` defines "
"``DEV_ENABLED``, disables optimization (``-O0``/``/0d``), enables generating "
"debug symbols, and does not define ``NDEBUG`` (so ``assert()`` works in "
"thirdparty libraries)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This flag appends the ``.dev`` suffix (for development) to the generated "
"binary name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are additional SCons options to enable *sanitizers*, which are tools "
"you can enable at compile-time to better debug certain engine issues. See :"
"ref:`doc_using_sanitizers` for more information."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Debugging symbols"
msgstr "Діагностика"

msgid ""
"By default, ``debug_symbols=no`` is used, which means **no** debugging "
"symbols are included in compiled binaries. Use ``debug_symbols=yes`` to "
"include debug symbols within compiled binaries, which allows debuggers and "
"profilers to work correctly. Debugging symbols are also required for Godot's "
"crash stacktraces to display with references to source code files and lines."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The downside is that debugging symbols are large files (significantly larger "
"than the binaries themselves). As a result, official binaries currently do "
"not include debugging symbols. This means you need to compile Godot yourself "
"to have access to debugging symbols."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using ``debug_symbols=yes``, you can also use "
"``separate_debug_symbols=yes`` to put debug information in a separate file "
"with a ``.debug`` suffix. This allows distributing both files independently. "
"Note that on Windows, when compiling with MSVC, debugging information is "
"*always* written to a separate ``.pdb`` file regardless of "
"``separate_debug_symbols``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the ``strip <path/to/binary>`` command to remove debugging symbols from "
"a binary you've already compiled."

msgid "Optimization level"
msgstr "Оптимізація"

msgid "Several compiler optimization levels can be chosen from:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``optimize=speed_trace`` *(default when targeting non-Web platforms)*: "
"Favors execution speed at the cost of larger binary size. Optimizations may "
"sometimes negatively impact debugger usage (stack traces may be less "
"accurate. If this occurs to you, use ``optimize=debug`` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``optimize=speed``: Favors even more execution speed, at the cost of even "
"larger binary size compared to ``optimize=speed_trace``. Even less friendly "
"to debugging compared to ``optimize=debug``, as this uses the most "
"aggressive optimizations available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``optimize=size`` *(default when targeting the Web platform)*: Favors small "
"binaries at the cost of slower execution speed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``optimize=debug``: Only enables optimizations that do not impact debugging "
"in any way. This results in faster binaries than ``optimize=none``, but "
"slower binaries than ``optimize=speed_trace``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``optimize=none``: Do not perform any optimization. This provides the "
"fastest build times, but the slowest execution times."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``optimize=custom`` *(advanced users only)*: Do not pass optimization "
"arguments to the C/C++ compilers. You will have to pass arguments manually "
"using the ``CFLAGS``, ``CCFLAGS`` and ``CXXFLAGS`` SCons options."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Architecture"
msgstr "текстури"

msgid ""
"The ``arch`` option is meant to control the CPU or OS version intended to "
"run the binaries. It is focused mostly on desktop platforms and ignored "
"everywhere else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Supported values for the ``arch`` option are **auto**, **x86_32**, "
"**x86_64**, **arm32**, **arm64**, **rv64**, **ppc32**, **ppc64** and "
"**wasm32**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This flag appends the value of ``arch`` to resulting binaries when "
"relevant.  The default value ``arch=auto`` detects the architecture that "
"matches the host platform."

#, fuzzy
msgid "Custom modules"
msgstr "Нетипові можливості"

msgid ""
"It's possible to compile modules residing outside of Godot's directory tree, "
"along with the built-in modules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A ``custom_modules`` build option can be passed to the command line before "
"compiling. The option represents a comma-separated list of directory paths "
"containing a collection of independent C++ modules that can be seen as C++ "
"packages, just like the built-in ``modules/`` directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For instance, it's possible to provide both relative, absolute, and user "
"directory paths containing such modules:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there's any custom module with the exact directory name as a built-in "
"module, the engine will only compile the custom one. This logic can be used "
"to override built-in module implementations."

msgid "Cleaning generated files"
msgstr "Як розпочати гру"

msgid ""
"Sometimes, you may encounter an error due to generated files being present. "
"You can remove them by using ``scons --clean <options>``, where "
"``<options>`` is the list of build options you've used to build Godot "
"previously."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can use ``git clean -fixd`` which will clean build "
"artifacts for all platforms and configurations. Beware, as this will remove "
"all untracked and ignored files in the repository. Don't run this command if "
"you have uncommitted work!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Other build options"
msgstr "Інші параметри збирання"

"Godot should be built (compiler, debug options, etc.) as well as the "
"features to include/disable."

msgid ""
"``SCONSFLAGS`` is an environment variable which is used by the SCons to set "
"the options automatically without having to supply them via the command line."
msgstr ""

"aforementioned ``-j`` option for all future builds:"
msgstr ""

msgid "SCU (single compilation unit) build"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regular builds tend to be bottlenecked by including large numbers of headers "
"in each compilation translation unit. Primarily to speed up development "
"(rather than for production builds), Godot offers a \"single compilation "
"unit\" build (aka \"Unity / Jumbo\" build)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the folders accelerated by this option, multiple ``.cpp`` files are "
"compiled in each translation unit, so headers can be shared between multiple "
"files, which can dramatically decrease build times."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When developing a Pull Request using SCU builds, be sure to make a regular "
"build prior to submitting the PR. This is because SCU builds by nature "
"include headers from earlier ``.cpp`` files in the translation unit, "
"therefore won't catch all the includes you will need in a regular build. The "
"CI will catch these errors but it will usually be faster to catch them on a "
"local build on your machine."

"build them yourself (in case you want newer ones, you are using custom "
"modules, or simply don't trust your own shadow)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you download the official export templates package and unzip it, you will "
"notice that most files are optimized binaries or packages for each platform:"

msgid ""
"To create those yourself, follow the instructions detailed for each platform "
"in this same tutorial section. Each platform explains how to create its own "
"template."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``version.txt`` file should contain the corresponding Godot version "
"identifier. This file is used to install export templates in a version-"
"specific directory to avoid conflicts. For instance, if you are building "
"export templates for Godot 3.1.1, ``version.txt`` should contain ``3.1.1."
"stable`` on the first line (and nothing else). This version identifier is "
"based on the ``major``, ``minor``, ``patch`` (if present) and ``status`` "
"lines of the `version.py file in the Godot Git repository <https://github."
"com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/version.py>`__."
