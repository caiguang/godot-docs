msgid "Optimizing a build for size"
msgstr ""

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr "Підґрунтя"

msgid ""
"Sometimes, it is desired to optimize a build for size rather than speed. "
"This means not compiling unused functions from the engine, as well as using "
"specific compiler flags to aid on decreasing build size. Common situations "
"include creating builds for mobile and Web platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial aims to give an overview on different methods to create a "
"smaller binary. Before continuing, it is recommended to read the previous "
"tutorials on compiling Godot for each platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The options below are listed from the most important (greatest size savings) "
"to the least important (lowest size savings)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stripping binaries"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Space savings:** Very high"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Difficulty:** Easy"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** Yes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you build Windows (MinGW), Linux or macOS binaries from source, remember "
"to strip debug symbols from binaries by installing the ``strip`` package "
"from your distribution then running:"
msgstr ""

msgid "On Windows, ``strip.exe`` is included in most MinGW toolchain setups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will reduce the size of compiled binaries by a factor between 5× and "
"10×. The downside is that crash backtraces will no longer provide accurate "
"information (which is useful for troubleshooting the cause of a crash). :ref:"
"`C++ profilers <doc_using_cpp_profilers>` will also no longer be able to "
"display function names (this does not affect the built-in GDScript profiler)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above command will not work on Windows binaries compiled with MSVC and "
"platforms such as Android and Web. Instead, pass ``debug_symbols=no`` on the "
"SCons command line when compiling."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compiling with link-time optimization"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Space savings:** High"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enabling link-time optimization produces more efficient binaries, both in "
"terms of performance and file size. It works by eliminating duplicate "
"template functions and unused code. It can currently be used with the GCC "
"and MSVC compilers:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Linking becomes much slower and more RAM-consuming with this option, so it "
"should be used only for release builds:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When compiling the ``master`` branch, you need to have at least 8 GB of RAM "
"available for successful linking with LTO enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When compiling the ``3.x`` branch, you need to have at least 6 GB of RAM "
"available for successful linking with LTO enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Optimizing for size instead of speed"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** Yes, but only for web builds"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot 3.1 onwards allows compiling using size optimizations (instead of "
"speed). To enable this, set the ``optimize`` flag to ``size``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some platforms such as WebAssembly already use this mode by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling advanced text server"
msgstr "Вимкнення конкретних об'єктів"

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** No"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Godot uses an advanced text server with the support for the "
"following features:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Right-to-left typesetting and complex scripts, required to write languages "
"such as Arabic and Hebrew."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Font ligatures and OpenType features (such as small capitals, fractions and "
"slashed zero)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides a fallback text server that isn't compiled by default. This "
"text server can be used as a lightweight alternative to the default advanced "
"text server:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you only intend on supporting Latin, Greek and Cyrillic-based languages "
"in your project, the fallback text server should suffice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This fallback text server can also process large amounts of text more "
"quickly than the advanced text server. This makes the fallback text server a "
"good fit for mobile/web projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remember to always pass ``module_text_server_fb_enabled=yes`` when using "
"``module_text_server_adv_enabled=no``. Otherwise, the compiled binary won't "
"contain any text server, which means no text will be displayed at all when "
"running the project."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling 3D"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Space savings:** Moderate"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 2D games, having the whole 3D engine available usually makes no sense. "
"Because of this, there is a build flag to disable it:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tools must be disabled in order to use this flag, as the editor is not "
"designed to operate without 3D support. Without it, the binary size can be "
"reduced by about 15%."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling advanced GUI objects"
msgstr "Вимкнення конкретних об'єктів"

msgid ""
"Most small games don't require complex GUI controls such as Tree, ItemList, "
"TextEdit or GraphEdit. They can be disabled using a build flag:"

msgid ""
"A lot of Godot's functions are offered as modules. You can see a list of "
"modules with the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The list of modules that can be disabled will appear, together with all "
"build options. If you are working on a simple 2D game, you could disable a "
"lot of them:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this proves not to work for your use case, you should review the list of "
"modules and see which ones you actually still need for your game (e.g. you "
"might want to keep networking-related modules, regex support, ``minimp3``/"
"``ogg``/``vorbis`` to play music, or ``theora`` to play videos)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can supply a list of disabled modules by creating "

msgid "Desktop"
msgstr "**Опис**"

msgid ""
"This section is only relevant when distributing the files on a desktop "
"platform that doesn't perform its own compression or packing. As such, this "
"advice is relevant when you distribute ZIP archives on itch.io or GitHub "
"Releases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Platforms like Steam already apply their own compression scheme, so you "
"don't need to create a ZIP archive to distribute files in the first place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As an aside, you can look into optimizing the distribution of your project "
"itself. This can be done even without recompiling the export template."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`7-Zip <https://7-zip.org/>`__ can be used to create ZIP archives that are "
"more efficient than usual, while remaining compatible with every ZIP "
"extractor (including Windows' own built-in extractor). ZIP size reduction in "
"a large project can reach dozens of megabytes compared to a typical ZIP "
"compressor, although average savings are in the 1-5 MB range. Creating this "
"ZIP archive will take longer than usual, but it will extract just as fast as "
"any other ZIP archive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the 7-Zip GUI, this is done by creating a ZIP archive with the "
"Ultra compression mode. When using the command line, this is done using the "
"following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Web"
msgstr "Інтернет"

msgid ""
"Enabling gzip or Brotli compression for all file types from the web export "
"(especially the ``.wasm`` and ``.pck``) can reduce the download size "
"significantly, leading to faster loading times, especially on slow "
"connections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creating precompressed gzip or Brotli files with a high compression level "
"can be even more efficient, as long as the web server is configured to serve "
"those files when they exist. When supported, Brotli should be preferred over "
"gzip as it has a greater potential for file size reduction."
