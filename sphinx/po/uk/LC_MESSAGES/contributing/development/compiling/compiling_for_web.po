msgid "To compile export templates for the Web, the following is required:"

msgid "`Python 3.6+ <https://www.python.org/>`__."

"Before starting, confirm that ``emcc`` is available in your PATH. This is "
"usually configured by the Emscripten SDK, e.g. when invoking ``emsdk "
"activate`` and ``source ./emsdk_env.sh``/``emsdk_env.bat``."

msgid ""
"Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the engine source "
"code. Then instruct SCons to build the Web platform. Specify ``target`` as "
"either ``template_release`` for a release build or ``template_debug`` for a "
"debug build::"

msgid ""
"By default, the :ref:`JavaScript singleton <doc_javascript_eval>` will be "
"built into the engine. Official export templates also have the JavaScript "
"singleton enabled. Since ``eval()`` calls can be a security concern, the "
"``javascript_eval`` option can be used to build without the singleton::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The engine will now be compiled to WebAssembly by Emscripten. Once finished, "
"the resulting file will be placed in the ``bin`` subdirectory. Its name is "
"``godot.web.template_release.wasm32.zip`` for release or ``godot.web."
"template_debug.wasm32.zip`` for debug."

"The default export templates do not include GDExtension support for "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will serve the contents of the ``bin/`` folder and open the default web "
