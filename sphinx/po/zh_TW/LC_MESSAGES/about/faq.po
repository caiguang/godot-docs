"While Godot internally attempts to use cache coherency as much as possible, "
"we believe users don't need to be forced to use DOD practices."
msgstr ""
"雖然 Godot 內部有儘可能地試著在很多吃效能的工作上都使用了快取一致性 (Cache "
"Coherency) 機制，但我們認為多數使用者都不是真的有需要強制使用 DoD (Data "
"oriented Design，資料導向設計)。"

"DOD is mostly a cache coherency optimization that can only provide "
"significant performance improvements when dealing with dozens of thousands "
"of objects which are processed every frame with little modification. That "
"is, if you are moving a few hundred sprites or enemies per frame, DOD won't "
"result in a meaningful improvement in performance. In such a case, you "
"should consider a different approach to optimization."

"DoD 基本上就是一個快取一致性最佳化機制，只能讓處理成千上萬個物件 (每一影格都"
"需要執行一些少量的修改) 時能讓效能有顯著提升。舉個例子，若每一影格都需要移動"
"上百個 Sprite 或敵人時，DoD 就沒什麼用了，需要考慮另一種最佳化的方式。"

"The vast majority of games do not need this and Godot provides handy helpers "
"to do the job for most cases when you do."

"If a game needs to process such a large amount of objects, our "
"recommendation is to use C++ and GDExtensions for performance-heavy tasks "
"and GDScript (or C#) for the rest of the game."
msgstr ""
"如果真的有遊戲需要處理這麼大量的物件，我們建議使用 C++ 與 GDNative 來處理吃效"
"能的部分，剩下的部分則使用 GDScript (或 C#)。"
