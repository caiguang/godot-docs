msgid "Introduction to Godot"
msgstr "序言"

msgid ""
"This article is here to help you figure out whether Godot might be a good "
"fit for you. We will introduce some broad features of the engine to give you "
"a feel for what you can achieve with it and answer questions such as \"what "
"do I need to know to get started?\"."
msgstr ""
"本文可幫助你瞭解 Godot 是否適合你。我們將介紹該引擎的一些廣泛的功能，讓你感受"
"到它能實作什麼，並回答“入門需要知道什麼？”等問題。"

msgid ""
"This is by no means an exhaustive overview. We will introduce many more "
"features in this getting started series."

msgstr "不能做什麼？"

msgid ""
"Godot is a general-purpose 2D and 3D game engine designed to support all "
"sorts of projects. You can use it to create games or applications you can "
"then release on desktop or mobile, as well as on the web."
msgstr ""
"Godot 是一個通用的 2D 和 3D 遊戲引擎，旨在支援各種專案。你可以用它來建立遊戲"

"programming skills or a developer to port the game for you."
msgstr ""
"你也可以用它來建立主機平臺的遊戲，儘管你需要很強的程式設計技能，或者需要一個"
"開發者為你移植遊戲。"

msgid ""
"The Godot team can't provide an open source console export due to the "
"licensing terms imposed by console manufacturers. Regardless of the engine "
"you use, though, releasing games on consoles is always a lot of work. You "
"can read more on that here: :ref:`doc_consoles`."
msgstr ""
"由於遊戲主機製造商施加的許可條款，Godot 團隊無法提供開源的主機匯出項。但是無"
"論使用哪種引擎，在主機上發行遊戲始終是一項繁重的工作。更多相關內容： :ref:"
"`doc_consoles` 。"

msgid "What can the engine do?"
msgstr "這個引擎能幹什麼？"

msgid ""
"Godot was initially developed in-house by an Argentinian game studio. Its "
"development started in 2001, and the engine was rewritten and improved "
"tremendously since its open source release in 2014."
msgstr ""
"Godot 最初是由一家阿根廷遊戲工作室內部開發的。開發始於 2001 年，2014 年開源發"

"Fury."
msgstr "使用 Godot 建立的遊戲的一些例子包括《Ex-Zodiac》和《Helms of Fury》。"

msgid ""
"As for applications, the open source pixel art drawing program Pixelorama is "
"powered by Godot, and so is the voxel RPG creator RPG in a box."
msgstr ""
"應用程式方面，開源的像素藝術繪畫程式 Pixelorama 是由 Godot 驅動的，體素 RPG "

"code in VSCode_ and Emacs_ for GDScript and C#. We also support Visual "
"Studio for C# on Windows."
msgstr ""
"當然，如果你願意，你可以用外部程式工作。我們官方支援匯入在 Blender_ 中設計的"

msgid "Programming languages"
msgstr "設計語言"

msgid "Let's talk about the available programming languages."
msgstr "我們來看看現有的程式設計語言。"

msgid ""
"You can code your games using :ref:`GDScript <toc-learn-scripting-"
"gdscript>`, a Godot-specific and tightly integrated language with a "
"lightweight syntax, or :ref:`C# <toc-learn-scripting-C#>`, which is popular "
"in the games industry. These are the two main scripting languages we support."
msgstr ""
"您可以使用 :ref:`GDScript <toc-learn-scripting-gdscript>` 編寫遊戲，它是一門"

msgid ""
"With the GDExtension technology, you can also write gameplay or high-"
"performance algorithms in C or C++ without recompiling the engine. You can "
"use this technology to integrate third-party libraries and other Software "
"Development Kits (SDK) in the engine."
msgstr ""
"通過 GDExtension 技術，你也可以用 C 或 C++ 編寫遊戲玩法相關或高性能演算法，而"

"lot from knowing how to think like a programmer first."
msgstr ""
"Godot 是一個功能豐富的遊戲引擎。它有成千上萬的功能，有很多東西需要學習。為了"
"充分利用它，你需要良好的程式設計基礎。雖然我們試圖讓引擎變得簡單易懂，但如果"

msgid ""
"Godot relies on the object-oriented programming paradigm. Being comfortable "
"with concepts such as classes and objects will help you code efficiently in "
"it."
msgstr ""
"Godot 依賴物件導向程式設計規範。熟悉類、物件之類的概念可以更有效率地去寫程式"

"If you are entirely new to programming, we recommend following the `CS50 "
"open courseware`_ from Harvard University. It's a great free course that "
"will teach you everything you need to know to be off to a good start. It "
"will save you countless hours and hurdles learning any game engine afterward."
msgstr ""
"如果你是一個程式設計新手，我們建議你去觀看哈佛大學提供的 `CS50 open "

"In CS50, you will learn multiple programming languages. Don't be afraid of "
"that: programming languages have many similarities. The skills you learn "
"with one language transfer well to others."
