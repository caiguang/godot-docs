msgid "Killing the player"

"We can kill enemies by jumping on them, but the player still can't die. "
"Let's fix this."
msgstr ""
"我們可以通過跳到敵人身上來殺死他們，但玩家仍然不能死亡。讓我們來解決這個問"
"題。"

msgid ""
"We want to detect being hit by an enemy differently from squashing them. We "
"want the player to die when they're moving on the floor, but not if they're "
"in the air. We could use vector math to distinguish the two kinds of "
"collisions. Instead, though, we will use an :ref:`Area3D <class_Area3D>` "
"node, which works well for hitboxes."
msgstr ""
"我們希望偵測到被敵人擊中與壓扁敵人時的不同。我們希望玩家在地板上移動時死亡，"
"但如果他們在空中，則不會死亡。我們可以使用向量數學來區分這兩種碰撞。但是，我"
"們將使用 :ref:`Area3D <class_Area3D>` 節點，該節點適用於命中框。"

msgid "Hitbox with the Area node"
msgstr "使用 Area 節點製作攻擊框"

msgid ""
"Head back to the ``player.tscn`` scene and add a new child node :ref:`Area3D "
"<class_Area3D>`. Name it ``MobDetector`` Add a :ref:`CollisionShape3D "
"<class_CollisionShape3D>` node as a child of it."
msgstr ""
"回到 ``player.tscn`` 場景，新增一個新的 :ref:`Area3D <class_Area3D>`子節點。"
"把它命名為 ``MobDetector``（小怪偵測器）。新增一個 :ref:`CollisionShape3D "
"<class_CollisionShape3D>` 節點作為它的一個子節點。"

"Here is a trick you can use to make the collisions only happen when the "
"player is on the ground or close to it. You can reduce the cylinder's height "
"and move it up to the top of the character. This way, when the player jumps, "
"the shape will be too high up for the enemies to collide with it."
msgstr ""
"這裡有一個技巧，你可以用它來使碰撞只發生在玩家在地面上或靠近地面時。您可以降"
"低圓柱體的高度並將其向上移動到角色的頂部。這樣，當玩家跳躍時，形狀會太高，敵"
"人無法與之碰撞。"

"You also want the cylinder to be wider than the sphere. This way, the player "
"gets hit before colliding and being pushed on top of the monster's collision "
"box."
msgstr ""
"你還希望圓柱體比球體更寬。這樣一來，玩家在碰撞之前就會被擊中，並被推到怪物的"
"碰撞盒之上。"

msgid "The wider the cylinder, the more easily the player will get killed."
msgstr "圓柱體越寬，玩家就越容易被殺死。"

msgid ""
"Next, select the ``MobDetector`` node again, and in the *Inspector*, turn "
"**off** its *Monitorable* property. This makes it so other physics nodes "
"cannot detect the area. The complementary *Monitoring* property allows it to "
"detect collisions. Then, remove the *Collision -> Layer* and set the mask to "
"the \"enemies\" layer."
msgstr ""
"接下來，再次選擇 ``MobDetector`` 節點，並在*屬性面板*中， **關閉** 其 "
"*Monitorable* 屬性。這使得其他物理節點無法偵測到這個區域。補充的 "
"*Monitoring* 屬性允許它偵測碰撞。然後，清除 *Collision -> Layer*，並將遮罩設"
"定為“enemies”層。"

"When areas detect a collision, they emit signals. We're going to connect one "

"*Node* tab, double-click the ``body_entered`` signal and connect it to the "
"``Player``"
msgstr ""

"The *MobDetector* will emit ``body_entered`` when a :ref:`CharacterBody3D "
"<class_CharacterBody3D>` or a :ref:`RigidBody3D <class_RigidBody3D>` node "
"enters it. As it only masks the \"enemies\" physics layers, it will only "
"detect the ``Mob`` nodes."
msgstr ""
"當一個 :ref:`CharacterBody3D <class_CharacterBody3D>` 或 :ref:`RigidBody3D "
"<class_RigidBody3D>` 節點進入它時，*MobDetector* 將發出 ``body_entered`` 訊"
"號。由於它只遮罩了“enemies”實體層，它將只偵測 *Mob* 節點。"

msgid ""
"Code-wise, we're going to do two things: emit a signal we'll later use to "
"end the game and destroy the player. We can wrap these operations in a "
"``die()`` function that helps us put a descriptive label on the code."
msgstr ""
"從程式碼上看，我們要做兩件事：發出一個訊號，我們以後會用來結束遊戲，並銷毀玩"
"家。我們可以用 ``die()`` 函式來包裝這些操作，幫助我們給程式碼貼上描述性標籤。"

msgid ""
"Try the game again by pressing :kbd:`F5`. If everything is set up correctly, "
"the character should die when an enemy runs into the collider. Note that "
"without a ``Player``, the following line"
msgstr ""
"按 :kbd:`F5` 再試一下遊戲。如果一切設定正確，角色在被敵人碰到時應該會死亡"

msgid "gives error because there is no $Player!"
msgstr "由於此處沒有 $Player 導致的報告有錯！"

msgid ""
"Also note that the enemy colliding with the player and dying depends on the "
"size and position of the ``Player`` and the ``Mob``\\ 's collision shapes. "
"You may need to move them and resize them to achieve a tight game feel."
msgstr ""
"另外請注意，敵人與玩家碰撞並死亡取決於 ''Player'' 和 ''Mob'' 的碰撞形狀的大小"
"和位置。你可能需要移動它們，調整它們的大小，以達到緊湊的遊戲感覺。"

msgid "Ending the game"
msgstr "執行遊戲"

msgid ""
"We can use the ``Player``\\ 's ``hit`` signal to end the game. All we need "

"我們可以利用 ''Player'' 的 ''hit'' 信號來結束遊戲。我們所要做的就是將它連接"

"If you try the game now, the monsters will stop spawning when you die, and "

msgstr "如果你現在試玩遊戲，你死亡後就會停止刷怪，現有的怪物會離開螢幕。"

"You can pat yourself in the back: you prototyped a complete 3D game, even if "
"it's still a bit rough."
msgstr "你可以鼓勵鼓勵自己了：你做出了完整 3D 遊戲的原型，雖說還有點粗糙。"

"From there, we'll add a score, the option to retry the game, and you'll see "
