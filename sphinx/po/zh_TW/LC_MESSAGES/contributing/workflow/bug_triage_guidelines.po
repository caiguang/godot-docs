msgstr "將 Godot Engine 組織成員中其中一位貢獻者設定為「Assignee (負責人)」"

msgid ""
"As the Godot engine organization on GitHub currently has a restricted number "

"contributors are welcome to take on any issue, if relevant after mentioning "
"it on the issue ticket and/or discussing the best way to resolve it with "
"other developers."
msgstr ""
"由於 Godot Engine 在 GitHub 上的組織目前還只有有限的貢獻者，因此我們還沒很常"

"*Confirmed*: has been confirmed by at least one other contributor than the "
"bug reporter (typically for *Bug* reports). The purpose of this label is to "
"let developers know which issues are still reproducible when they want to "
"select what to work on. It is therefore a good practice to add in a comment "
"on what platform and what version or commit of Godot the issue could be "
"reproduced; if a developer looks at the issue one year later, the "
"*Confirmed* label may not be relevant anymore."
msgstr ""
"**Confirmed**: 已確認。由至少一位除了回報 Bug 的人以外的開發者確認 (通常用於 "
"**Bug** 回報)。設定該 Label 是要讓其他開發人員在要處理 Issue 時知道那些 "
"Issue 目前仍可重現。因此，在註解中寫上能復現該 Issue 的平台與 Godot 版本或 "

msgstr ""
