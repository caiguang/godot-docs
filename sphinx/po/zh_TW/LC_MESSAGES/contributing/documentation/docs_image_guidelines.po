msgid "Creating documentation images"
msgstr "本地化說明文件圖片"

msgid ""
"Throughout documentation images are often needed to make the explanation of "
"a feature or concept as clear as possible for a reader. This page will "
"explain the process from beginning to end."
msgstr ""
"在整個檔案中，通常需要圖像來使讀者盡可能清楚地解釋功能或概念。本頁將從頭到尾"
"解釋該過程。"

msgid "Capturing an image"
msgstr "建立內容"

msgid ""
"To take a picture of something in Godot a screen capture tool can be used."
msgstr "可以使用螢幕截圖工具截取 Godot 中的內容。"

msgid ""
"On Windows 10 and 11 that would be the Snip & Sketch program. Pressing :kbd:"
"`Windows + Shift + S` lets you take a screenshot of a portion of the screen "
"and save it to the clipboard. After pressing those keys, click and drag over "
"the area you wish to take a picture of."
msgstr ""
"在 Windows 10 和 11 上，這將是 Snip & Sketch 程式。按:kbd:`Windows + Shift + "
"S`可以截取螢幕一部分的螢幕截圖並儲存到剪貼簿。按下這些按鍵後，按一下並拖曳您"
"想要拍照的區域。"

msgid ""
"On macOS, pressing :kbd:`Shift + Command + 3` does the same. To take a "
"picture of the entire screen press :kbd:`Shift + Command + 4`. All "
"screenshots taken will be saved to the desktop."
msgstr ""
"在 macOS 上，按 :kbd:`Shift + Command + 3` 具有相同的效果。若要拍攝整個螢幕的"
"照片，請按 :kbd:`Shift + Command + 4`。所有截取的螢幕截圖都將儲存到桌面。"

msgid ""
"Each Linux desktop environment has it's own screenshot tool. For example, on "
"KDE Plasma the program Spectacle is used for taking screenshots. If your "
"distribution doesn't come with one by default try searching its package "
"repository, or Flathub if that's supported."
msgstr ""
"每個 Linux 桌面環境都有自己的螢幕截圖工具。例如，在 KDE Plasma 上，Spectacle "
"程式用於截取螢幕截圖。如果您的發行版預設沒有附帶，請嘗試搜尋其軟體包儲存庫，"
"或者如果支援的話，搜尋 Flathub。"

msgid ""
"All screenshots should ideally be taken on a 1080p screen. Anything higher "
"resolution is adding detail that doesn't make the documentation better and "
"dramatically increases file size. If you're taking screenshots on a higher "
"resolution screen the screenshot should be scaled down. There are "
"instructions on how to do this later on this page."
msgstr ""
"理想情況下，所有螢幕截圖都應在 1080p 螢幕上拍攝。任何更高的解析度都會增加細"
"節，這不會使檔案變得更好，並且會顯著增加檔案大小。如果您在更高解析度的螢幕上"
"截取螢幕截圖，則螢幕截圖應該會按比例縮小。本頁稍後會提供有關如何執行此操作的"
"說明。"

msgid "Format conversion"
msgstr "Godot 版本"

msgid ""
"The current format for images in Godot's documentation is WebP (``.webp``). "
"While some Linux programs will support saving screenshots in this format, "
"macOS and the Snip & Sketch program on Windows do not. For images that don't "
"need editing, such as precise cropping or adding outlines, Squoosh can be "
"used. `Squoosh <https://squoosh.app/>`_ is a converter developed by Google, "
"is open source, and doesn't give Google any image rights by using it. When "
"choosing compression if you can get an image that's under 300KB in size use "
"lossless compression. If it's over 300KB use just enough lossy compression "
"to get it under that size. If this results in noticable compression "
"artifacts using less compression is fine, even if the file size is bigger."
msgstr ""
"Godot 檔案中目前的圖像格式是 WebP (``.webp``)。雖然某些 Linux 程式支援以這種"
"格式儲存螢幕截圖，但 macOS 和 Windows 上的 Snip & Sketch 程式不支援。對於不需"
"要編輯的圖像，例如精確裁剪或新增輪廓，可以使用 Squoosh。 `Squoosh <https://"
"squoosh.app/>`_ 是由 Google 開發的轉換器，是開源的，並且不會透過使用它向 "
"Google 授予任何圖像權利。選擇壓縮時，如果您可以獲得大小低於 300KB 的影像，請"
"使用無損壓縮。如果超過 300KB，請使用足夠的有損壓縮來使其低於該大小。如果這會"
"導致明顯的壓縮偽影，則使用較少的壓縮就可以了，即使檔案大小較大。"

msgid ""
"If you already have an image editor such as GIMP, Krita or Photoshop "
"installed it may have the ability to open an image then save it as a WebP "
"file."
msgstr ""
"如果您已經安裝了 GIMP、Krita 或 Photoshop 等影像編輯器，它可能能夠開啟影像，"
"然後將其儲存為 WebP 檔案。"

msgid "Cropping"
msgstr "Looping - 循環"

msgid ""
"For a screenshot of a 2D or 3D scene in the editor the above steps will be "
"enough. But for most UI images some extra work should be done, specifically "
"cropping to make an image look clean. Below is an example of good cropping."
msgstr ""
"對於編輯器中 2D 或 3D 場景的螢幕截圖，上述步驟就足夠了。但對於大多數 UI 圖"
"像，應該做一些額外的工作，特別是裁剪以使圖像看起來乾淨。以下是良好裁剪的範"
"例。"

msgid ""
"For cropping Krita is the recommended program. While some screenshot "
"programs do have cropping built in it's not always easy to get something "
"precise. And while Krita is designed as a painting program the cropping tool "
"gives you pixel precision by default. Of course, feel free to use a "
"different program you are familiar with."
msgstr ""
"對於裁剪，Krita 是推薦的程式。雖然某些螢幕截圖程式確實內建了裁剪功能，但獲得"
"精確的結果並不總是那麼容易。雖然 Krita 被設計為繪畫程式，但裁剪工具預設為您提"
"供像素精度。當然，您可以隨意使用您熟悉的其他程式。"

msgid ""
"If you've never used Krita before download it from the `official Krita "
"website <https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/>`_, on Linux you may "
"also be able to download it from your distributions repository, flathub is "
"also an option. Once it's installed on your computer open Krita then open "
"the image you want to crop. This button on the left panel is the crop tool."
msgstr ""
"如果您以前從未使用過 Krita，請從「官方 Krita 網站 <https://krita.org/en/"
"download/krita-desktop/>」下載它，在 Linux 上您也可以從您的發行版下載它儲存"
"庫、flathub 也是一個選項。將其安裝到電腦上後，打開 Krita，然後打開要裁剪的圖"
"像。左側面板上的這個按鈕是裁切工具。"

msgid ""
"After selecting it, click on the image, you should now have cropping tools "
"available."
msgstr "選擇它後，單擊圖像，您現在應該可以使用裁剪工具。"

msgid ""
"Click and drag the white boxes to adjust what gets cropped, if you zoom in "
"close to the image you will see the individual pixels in an image, which is "
"useful for precision."
msgstr ""
"點擊並拖曳白色框以調整裁剪的內容，如果放大到靠近圖像，您將看到圖像中的各個像"
"素，這對於精確度很有用。"

msgid ""
"If you make a mistake and overcrop don't worry, cropping is non-destructive "
"in Krita and can be adjusted. Click on the image with your cropping tool "
"still selected and the controls will return."
msgstr ""
"如果您犯了錯誤並且過度裁剪，請不要擔心，Krita 中的裁剪是非破壞性的，並且可以"
"進行調整。在仍選擇裁切工具的情況下按一下影像，控制項將會傳回。"

msgid "Scaling down an image"
msgstr "本地化說明文件圖片"

msgid ""
"As explained earlier on this page, all images taken on a screen that is a "
"higher resolution than 1080p should be scaled down. To do this in Krita "
"click on **Image** on the top bar, and from the dropdown menu select **Scale "
"Image To New Size**. This menu can also be opened by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl + "
"Alt + I`. On this menu you want to adjust the pixel dimensions. For anything "
"taken on a 4K monitor change the value of the width and height to half of "
"its current value, for anything taken on a 1440p monitor multiply the width "
"and height by 0.75. Make sure the **Constrain Proportions** box at the "
"bottom of the menu is checked so you only have to change 1 value."
msgstr ""
"如本頁前面所解釋的，在解析度高於 1080p 的螢幕上拍攝的所有影像都應按比例縮小。"
"要在 Krita 中執行此操作，請點擊頂部欄上的 **圖像**，然後從下拉式選單中選擇 **"
"將圖像縮放到新尺寸**。也可以按 :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt + I` 開啟此選單。在此選單上，"
"您要調整像素尺寸。對於在 4K 顯示器上拍攝的任何內容，請將寬度和高度的值變更為"
"其目前值的一半；對於在 1440p 顯示器上拍攝的任何內容，請將寬度和高度乘以 "
"0.75。確保選取選單底部的 **約束比例** 框，這樣您只需變更 1 個值。"

msgid "Saving as WebP in Krita"
msgstr "在 Krita 中保存為 WebP"

msgid ""
"To save an image as webp if it isn't already one, Go to **File > Save As**. "
"Select **webp** from the **Save as type:** dropdown, then choose wherever "
"you want to save it. After clicking **Save** a menu will popup with webp "
"options. Make sure **Losses** is checked and **Quality** is set to 100%. "
"This means the image will not lose detail and will be as small as possible."
msgstr ""
"若要將圖像另存為 webp（如果還不是），請前往 **檔案 > 另存為**。從 **儲存型"
"別：** 下拉列表中選擇 **webp**，然後選擇要儲存的位置。點擊 **儲存** 後，將彈"
"出一個帶有 webp 選項的選單。確保選取 **Losses** 並將 **Quality** 設為 100%。"
"這意味著圖像不會丟失細節並且會盡可能小。"

msgid ""
"If the image is over 300KB in size try compressing it losslessly using "
"`Squoosh <https://squoosh.app/>`_. If it's still over 300KB change to lossy "
"compression and slowly increase the compression until it's under 300KB. If "
"this results in noticable compression artifacts using less compression is "
"fine, even if the file size is bigger."
msgstr ""
"如果圖像大小超過 300KB，請嘗試使用 `Squoosh <https://squoosh.app/>`_ 無失真壓"
"縮。如果它仍然超過 300KB，則更改為失真壓縮，並緩慢增加壓縮，直到它低於 "
"300KB。如果這導致使用較少的壓縮產生明顯的壓縮偽影，那麼即使檔大小更大，也沒有"
"關係。"

msgid "Outlines arrows and text"
msgstr "為箭頭和文字新增輪廓"

msgid ""
"Sometimes an image needs something extra to properly direct the readers "
"attention, or make something clear. Outlines and arrows can be used for this "
"purpose. For these types of edits Inkscape is the recommended open source "
"program, it can be downloaded from the `official Inkscape website <https://"
"inkscape.org/>`_. Like Krita, if you're on Linux you can also check your "
"distributions repository or get it from Flathub."
msgstr ""
"有時，一張圖片需要一些額外的東西來適當的引導讀者的注意力，或者讓一些東西變得"
"清晰。輪廓線和箭頭可以用於此目的。對於這些型別的編輯，Inkscape 是推薦的開來源"
"程式，可以從`Inkscap 官方網站<https://inkscape.org/>`_ 下載 。像 Krita 一樣，"
"如果你在 Linux 上，你也可以檢查你的發行版本倉庫或從 Flatchub 獲取。"

msgid ""
"A full tutorial on creating outlines is not provided here, we recommend "
"searching for various tutorials on how to use it online. However there are "
"two standards for doc image outlines and arrows. First, the color should be "
"yellow, specifically this hex color: ``fffb44`` (``fffb44ff`` if there is a "
"transparency value like in Inkscape). This color was chosen specifically to "
"make sure color blind people do not have issues reading the documentation, "
"other colors can be used in addition to this yellow if multiple outlines on "
"an image are needed, red should be avoided. The second standard is that all "
"outlines and arrow lines should be 2 pixels wide."
msgstr ""
"這裡沒有提供關於建立輪廓的完整教學，我們建議搜索各種關於如何線上使用它的教"
"學。但是，文件圖像輪廓和箭頭有兩個標準。首先，顏色應該是黃色，特別是這種十六"
"進位顏色： ``fffb44`` （如果有像 Inkscape 中那樣的透明度值，則為 "
"``fffb44ff`` ）。選擇這種顏色是為了確保色盲在閱讀文件時不會遇到問題，如果需要"
"在圖像上使用多個輪廓，則除了這種黃色之外，還可以使用其他顏色，應避免使用紅"
"色。第二個標準是所有的輪廓和箭頭線都應該是 2 像素寬。"

msgid ""
"Finally, some images might require text to differentiate multiple parts of "
"an image. There are no strict requirements other than use an easy to read "
"non fancy font. As for color the yellow color from before should also be "
"used, but black or other colors can be used if appropriate. For example, if "
"yellow blends into the image, or if there are multiple outlines in multiple "
"colors."
msgstr ""
"最後，一些圖像可能需要文字來區分圖像的多個部分。除了使用易讀的非花哨字形外，"
"沒有其他嚴格的要求。至於顏色，也應該使用以前的黃色，但如果合適，可以使用黑色"
"或其他顏色。例如，如果黃色混合到圖像中，或者如果存在多種顏色的多個輪廓。"

msgid "Adding an image to a documentation page"
msgstr "更新說明文件樣板"

msgid ""
"Once you've finished working on your image, it can be added to the "
"documentation. All images are stored in folders named ``img`` next to the "
"page they are used in."
msgstr ""
"完成影像處理後，就可以將它新增到文件中了。所有的圖像都保存在使用它們的頁面旁"
"邊的名為 ``img`` 的資料夾中。"

msgid ""
"To add your image, add it to the ``img`` folder that's in the same folder as "
"the ``.rst`` file for the page (create it if it doesn't exist). In the ``."
"rst`` page, images should be included with the following code snippet::"
msgstr ""
"要新增圖像，請將其新增到 ``img`` 資料夾中，該資料夾與頁面的 ``.rst`` 檔位於同"
"一資料夾中（如果不存在，請建立它）。在 ``.rst`` 頁面中，圖像應包含在以下程式"
"碼片段中 ::"

msgid ""
"Where ``documentation_image.webp`` would be changed to the name of the image "
"you created. Name your images in a way that makes their meaning clear, "
"possibly with a prefix that makes their relationship to a documentation page "
"explicit."
msgstr ""
"其中 ``documentation_image.webp`` 將更改為所建立圖像的名稱。以明確的方式為圖"
"像命名，可以的話使用前綴明確表示它們與文件頁面的關係。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
