msgid "Optimizing a build for size"
msgstr "最佳化建置檔案大小"

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr "理由"

msgid ""
"Sometimes, it is desired to optimize a build for size rather than speed. "
"This means not compiling unused functions from the engine, as well as using "
"specific compiler flags to aid on decreasing build size. Common situations "
"include creating builds for mobile and Web platforms."
msgstr ""
"有時候，我們會優先最佳化建置大小而不是速度。也就是不編譯引擎內沒用到的功能，"
"以及使用特定的編譯旗標來降低建置的大小。常見的情況如為行動平台與 Web 平台。"

msgid ""
"This tutorial aims to give an overview on different methods to create a "
"smaller binary. Before continuing, it is recommended to read the previous "
"tutorials on compiling Godot for each platform."
msgstr ""
"本教學旨在提供各種能縮小二進位檔的方法概覽。繼續之前，建議先閱讀為各個平台編"
"譯 Godot 的教學。"

msgid ""
"The options below are listed from the most important (greatest size savings) "
"to the least important (lowest size savings)."
msgstr ""
"下面的選項按照從最重要（大小節省得最多）到最不重要（大小節省得最少）的順序排"
"列。"

msgid "Stripping binaries"
msgstr "在二進位檔中移除"

msgid "**Space savings:** Very high"
msgstr "**節省空間：**非常高"

msgid "**Difficulty:** Easy"
msgstr "**難度：**簡單"

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** Yes"
msgstr "**在官方建構中執行：**是"

msgid ""
"If you build Windows (MinGW), Linux or macOS binaries from source, remember "
"to strip debug symbols from binaries by installing the ``strip`` package "
"from your distribution then running:"
msgstr ""
"如果你從源碼建構了 Windows（MinGW）、Linux、macOS 的二進位檔案，請記得剝離二"
"進位檔案中的除錯符號。首先請安裝你的發行版本中的 ``strip`` 包，然後執行："

msgid "On Windows, ``strip.exe`` is included in most MinGW toolchain setups."
msgstr "在 Windows 上，大多數 MinGW 工具鏈安裝時都會包含 ``strip.exe``。"

msgid ""
"This will reduce the size of compiled binaries by a factor between 5× and "
"10×. The downside is that crash backtraces will no longer provide accurate "
"information (which is useful for troubleshooting the cause of a crash). :ref:"
"`C++ profilers <doc_using_cpp_profilers>` will also no longer be able to "
"display function names (this does not affect the built-in GDScript profiler)."
msgstr ""
"這樣可以將編譯後二進位檔案減少到原先五分之一到十分之一的大小。缺點是當機追蹤"
"中就無法再提供準確的資訊了（可用於搜尋當機原因）。:ref:`C++ 性能分析器 "
"<doc_using_cpp_profilers>`也將無法顯示函式名稱（不影響內建的 GDScript 性能分"
"析器）。"

"The above command will not work on Windows binaries compiled with MSVC and "
"platforms such as Android and Web. Instead, pass ``debug_symbols=no`` on the "
"SCons command line when compiling."
msgstr ""
"上面的命令無法用於使用 MSVC 編譯的 Windows 二進位檔案，Android 和 HTML5 等平"
"臺也一樣。作為替代，請在編譯時向 SCons 命令列傳遞 ``debug_symbols=no``。"

msgid "Compiling with link-time optimization"
msgstr "以連結時期最佳化進行編譯"

msgid "**Space savings:** High"
msgstr "**節省空間：**高"

msgid ""
"Enabling link-time optimization produces more efficient binaries, both in "
"terms of performance and file size. It works by eliminating duplicate "
"template functions and unused code. It can currently be used with the GCC "
"and MSVC compilers:"
msgstr ""
"開啟連結時期最佳化可產生效能與檔案大小都更有效率的二進位檔。連結時期最佳化是"
"通過清理重複的樣板功能與為使用的程式碼來達成的。目前可以在 GCC 與 MSVC 編譯器"
"上使用："

msgid ""
"Linking becomes much slower and more RAM-consuming with this option, so it "
"should be used only for release builds:"
msgstr "連結在開啟該選項時會變得特別慢，因此應該只用於釋出版本。"

msgid ""
"When compiling the ``master`` branch, you need to have at least 8 GB of RAM "
"available for successful linking with LTO enabled."
msgstr ""
"編譯 ``master`` 分支時，如果啟用了 LTO，那麼你需要至少 8 GB 可用記憶體才能成"
"功連結。"

msgid ""
"When compiling the ``3.x`` branch, you need to have at least 6 GB of RAM "
"available for successful linking with LTO enabled."
msgstr ""
"編譯 ``3.x`` 分支時，如果啟用了 LTO，那麼你需要至少 6 GB 可用記憶體才能成功連"

msgid "**Performed in official builds:** Yes, but only for web builds"
msgstr "**在官方建構中執行：**是，但僅限於 HTML5"

"Godot 3.1 onwards allows compiling using size optimizations (instead of "
"speed). To enable this, set the ``optimize`` flag to ``size``:"
msgstr ""
"Godot 3.1 後可進行大小最佳化 (而非速度)。若要啟用大小最佳化，請將 "

"By default, Godot uses an advanced text server with the support for the "
"following features:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Right-to-left typesetting and complex scripts, required to write languages "
"such as Arabic and Hebrew."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Font ligatures and OpenType features (such as small capitals, fractions and "
"slashed zero)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides a fallback text server that isn't compiled by default. This "
"text server can be used as a lightweight alternative to the default advanced "
"text server:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you only intend on supporting Latin, Greek and Cyrillic-based languages "
"in your project, the fallback text server should suffice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This fallback text server can also process large amounts of text more "
"quickly than the advanced text server. This makes the fallback text server a "
"good fit for mobile/web projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remember to always pass ``module_text_server_fb_enabled=yes`` when using "
"``module_text_server_adv_enabled=no``. Otherwise, the compiled binary won't "
"contain any text server, which means no text will be displayed at all when "
"running the project."

msgid "Disabling 3D"
msgstr "禁用 3D"

msgid "**Space savings:** Moderate"
msgstr "**節省空間：**一般"

msgid ""
"For 2D games, having the whole 3D engine available usually makes no sense. "
"Because of this, there is a build flag to disable it:"
msgstr ""
"對於 2D 遊戲來說，包含完整的 3D 引擎通常沒什麼意義。因此，可以使用一個建置旗"
"標來禁用："

msgid ""
"Tools must be disabled in order to use this flag, as the editor is not "
"designed to operate without 3D support. Without it, the binary size can be "
"reduced by about 15%."
msgstr ""
"必須要禁用 Tools 才能使用該旗標，因為編輯器並非設計給不支援 3D 的情景。關閉 "
"3D 支援後，二進位檔的大小約可以減少 15%。"
