"Most platforms have the option to request the application to quit. On "
"desktops, this is usually done with the \"x\" icon on the window title bar. "
"On Android, the back button is used to quit when on the main screen (and to "
"go back otherwise)."
msgstr ""
"大多數平臺都有要求應用程式退出的選項。在桌面系統中，這通常是通過視窗標題列上"
"的“x”圖示來實作的。在 Android 系統上，當在主螢幕上時，後退按鈕被用來退出（否"
"則就返回）。"

msgid "Handling the notification"
msgstr "處理通知"

msgid ""
"On desktop and web platforms, :ref:`Node <class_Node>` receives a special "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` notification when quitting is requested "
"from the window manager."
msgstr ""
"在桌面平臺上, :ref:`MainLoop <class_MainLoop>` 有一個特殊的 ``MainLoop."
"NOTIFICATION_WM_QUIT_REQUEST`` 通知, 當請求退出時, 會向所有節點發送."

msgid ""
"On Android, ``NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` is sent instead. Pressing "
"the Back button will exit the application if **Application > Config > Quit "
"On Go Back** is checked in the Project Settings (which is the default)."
msgstr ""
"在Android系統中, 會發送 ``MainLoop.NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` 代替. 如"
"果在專案設定中勾選了 **Application > Config > Quit On Go Back** (預設), 按"
"Back按鈕將退出應用程式."

msgid ""
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` isn't supported on iOS, as iOS devices "
"don't have a physical Back button."
msgstr ""
"``MainLoop.NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` 在iOS上不支援, 因為iOS裝置沒有實"
"體的Back按鈕."

msgid "Handling the notification is done as follows (on any node):"
msgstr "處理通知的方法如下(在任何節點上):"

msgid ""
"When developing mobile apps, quitting is not desired unless the user is on "
"the main screen, so the behavior can be changed."
msgstr ""
"在開發移動應用程式時, 除非使用者在主螢幕上, 否則不需要退出, 因此處理方式有變"
"化."

msgid ""
"It is important to note that by default, Godot apps have the built-in "
"behavior to quit when quit is requested from the window manager. This can be "
"changed, so that the user can take care of the complete quitting procedure:"
msgstr ""
"值得注意的是, 預設情況下, 在請求退出時,Godot應用程式具有退出的內建行為, 可以"
"更改為:"

msgid "Sending your own quit notification"
msgstr "Godot 通知"

msgid ""
"While forcing the application to close can be done by calling :ref:"
"`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>`, doing so will not send the "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` to the nodes in the scene tree. Quitting "
"by calling :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` will not "
"allow custom actions to complete (such as saving, confirming the quit, or "
"debugging), even if you try to delay the line that forces the quit."
msgstr ""
"雖然強迫應用程式關閉可以通過呼叫 :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 來完成，但這樣做不會發送退出的*通知*。這意味著"
"上面描述的函式不會被呼叫。通過呼叫 :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 來退出，將不允許自訂動作的完成（比如保存、確認"
"退出或除錯），即使你試圖延遲強制退出的行。"

msgid ""
"Instead, if you want to notify the nodes in the scene tree about the "
"upcoming program termination, you should send the notification yourself:"
msgstr ""
"相反，如果您想通知場景樹中的節點即將到來的程式終止，您應該自己發送通知："

msgid ""
"Sending this notification will inform all nodes about the program "
"termination, but will not terminate the program itself *unlike in 3.X*. In "
"order to achieve the previous behavior, :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` should be called after the notification."
msgstr ""
"發送此通知將通知所有節點有關程式終止的信息，但不會終止程式本身*與 3.X 中不同"
"*。為了實作前面的行為，應該在通知後呼叫 SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
