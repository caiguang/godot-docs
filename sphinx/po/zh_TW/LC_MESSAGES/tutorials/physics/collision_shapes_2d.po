"You can represent the collision of most smaller objects using one or more "

"We recommend favoring primitive shapes for dynamic objects such as "
"RigidBodies and CharacterBodies as their behavior is the most reliable. They "
"often provide better performance as well."
msgstr ""
"建議動態物件使用原始形狀, 如 RigidBodies 和 KinematicBodies, 因為它們的行為是"
"可靠的, 通常也能提供更好的性能."

msgid "Convex collision shapes"
msgstr "碰撞形體"

msgid ""
"Godot currently doesn't offer a built-in way to create 2D convex collision "
"shapes. This section is mainly here for reference purposes."
msgstr "Godot 目前不提供建立 2D 凸碰撞形狀的內建方法。這一部分主要是為了參考。"

msgid ""
":ref:`Convex collision shapes <class_ConvexPolygonShape2D>` are a compromise "
"between primitive collision shapes and concave collision shapes. They can "
"represent shapes of any complexity, but with an important caveat. As their "
"name implies, an individual shape can only represent a *convex* shape. For "
"instance, a pyramid is *convex*, but a hollow box is *concave*. To define a "
"concave object with a single collision shape, you need to use a concave "
"collision shape."
msgstr ""
":ref:`凸形碰撞形狀 <class_ConvexPolygonShape>` 是基礎碰撞形狀和凹形碰撞形狀之"
"間的折衷, 可以表示任何複雜的形狀, 但要警告的是, 正如名稱所示, 一個單獨的形狀"
"只能表示一個 *凸* 的形狀. 要用單個碰撞形狀定義一個凹形物件, 需要使用一個凹形"
"碰撞形狀. 例如, 一個金字塔是 *凸* 的, 但一個空心盒子是 *凹* 的."

msgid ""
"Depending on the object's complexity, you may get better performance by "
"using multiple convex shapes instead of a concave collision shape. Godot "
"lets you use *convex decomposition* to generate convex shapes that roughly "
"match a hollow object. Note this performance advantage no longer applies "
"after a certain amount of convex shapes. For large and complex objects such "
"as a whole level, we recommend using concave shapes instead."
msgstr ""
"根據物件的複雜程度, 可能要通過使用多個凸形而不是一個凹形碰撞形狀來獲得更好的"
"性能.Godot可以使用 *凸分解* 來生成與空心物體大致配對的凸形. 請注意, 在一定數"
"量的凸形之後, 就沒有了這種性能優勢, 對於大而複雜的物件, 如整個關卡, 建議使用"
"凹形代替."

msgid ""
":ref:`Concave collision shapes <class_ConcavePolygonShape2D>`, also called "
"trimesh collision shapes, can take any form, from a few triangles to "
"thousands of triangles. Concave shapes are the slowest option but are also "
"the most accurate in Godot. **You can only use concave shapes within "
"StaticBodies.** They will not work with CharacterBodies or RigidBodies "
"unless the RigidBody's mode is Static."
msgstr ""
":ref:`凹形碰撞形狀 <class_ConcavePolygonShape>`, 也稱為三角碰撞形狀, 可以採取"
"任何形式, 從幾個到數千個三角形, 凹形是最慢的選擇, 但也是Godot中最精確的.**除"
"非剛體的模式是靜態的, 否則它不能用於KinematicBodies動態體或RigidBodies剛體."

msgid ""
"Even though concave shapes offer the most accurate *collision*, contact "
"reporting can be less precise than primitive shapes."
msgstr "即使凹形提供了最準確的 *碰撞*, 但觸碰資訊的精度可能不如基礎形狀."

msgid ""
"When not using TileMaps for level design, concave shapes are the best "
"approach for a level's collision."
msgstr "當不使用 TileMap 進行關卡設計時，凹形是關卡碰撞的最佳方法。"

msgid ""
"You can configure the CollisionPolygon2D node's *build mode* in the "
"inspector. If it is set to **Solids** (the default), collisions will include "
"the polygon and its contained area. If it is set to **Segments**, collisions "
"will only include the polygon edges."
msgstr ""
"您可以在屬性面板中設定 CollisionPolygon2D 節點的*建置模式*。如果將其設為 "
"**Solids**（預設值），則碰撞將包括多邊形及其包含的區域。如果將其設為 "
"**Segments**，則碰撞將僅包括多邊形邊緣。"

msgid ""
"You can generate a concave collision shape from the editor by selecting a "
"Sprite2D and using the **Sprite2D** menu at the top of the 2D viewport. The "
"Sprite2D menu dropdown exposes an option called **Create CollisionPolygon2D "
"Sibling**. Once you click it, it displays a menu with 3 settings:"
msgstr ""
"選中一個網格實例，然後使用 3D 視口頂部的**網格**功能表就可以在編輯器中生成一"
"個凹形碰撞形狀。編輯器提供了兩個選項："

msgid ""
"**Simplification:** Higher values will result in a less detailed shape, "
"which improves performance at the cost of accuracy."
msgstr ""
"**簡化：** 較高的值將導致不太詳細的形狀，這會以犧牲準確性為代價提高性能。"

msgid ""
"**Shrink (Pixels):** Higher values will shrink the generated collision "
"polygon relative to the sprite's edges."
msgstr "**收縮（像素）：** 較高的值將相對於精靈的邊緣收縮所產生的碰撞多邊形。"

msgid ""
"**Grow (Pixels):** Higher values will grow the generated collision polygon "
"relative to the sprite's edges. Note that setting Grow and Shrink to equal "
"values may yield different results than leaving both of them on 0."
msgstr ""
"**成長（像素）：** 較高的值將使產生的碰撞多邊形相對於精靈的邊緣成長。請注意，"
"將 Grow 和 Shrink 設為相等的值可能會產生與將它們都保留為 0 不同的結果。"

msgid ""
"If you have an image with many small details, it's recommended to create a "
"simplified version and use it to generate the collision polygon. This can "
"result in better performance and game feel, since the player won't be "
"blocked by small, decorative details."
msgstr ""
"如果您的影像包含許多小細節，建議建立一個簡化版本並使用它來產生碰撞多邊形。這"
"可以帶來更好的性能和遊戲感覺，因為玩家不會被小的裝飾性細節所阻擋。"

msgid ""
"To use a separate image for collision polygon generation, create another "
"Sprite2D, generate a collision polygon sibling from it then remove the "
"Sprite2D node. This way, you can exclude small details from the generated "
"collision."
msgstr ""
"若要使用單獨的映像來產生碰撞多邊形，請建立另一個 Sprite2D，從中產生碰撞多邊形"
"同級，然後刪除 Sprite2D 節點。這樣，您可以從生成的碰撞中排除小細節。"

msgid "Performance caveats"
msgstr "效能"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"You aren't limited to a single collision shape per PhysicsBody. Still, we "
"recommend keeping the number of shapes as low as possible to improve "
"performance, especially for dynamic objects like RigidBodies and "
"CharacterBodies. On top of that, avoid translating, rotating, or scaling "
"CollisionShapes to benefit from the physics engine's internal optimizations."
msgstr ""
"每個PhysicsBody(物理體)不限於一個碰撞形狀. 儘管如此, 我們還是建議儘量減少碰撞"
"形狀的數量以提高性能, 特別是對於像RigidBodies (剛體)和KinematicBodies(運動體)"
"這樣的動態物件. 除此之外, 避免translating(平移), rotating(旋轉)或scaling(縮"
"放)碰撞形狀, 可以提高物理引擎運作效率."

msgid ""
"When using a single non-transformed collision shape in a StaticBody, the "
"engine's *broad phase* algorithm can discard inactive PhysicsBodies. The "
"*narrow phase* will then only have to take into account the active bodies' "
"shapes. If a StaticBody has many collision shapes, the broad phase will "
"fail. The narrow phase, which is slower, must then perform a collision check "
"against each shape."
msgstr ""
"在靜態體中使用單個非轉換碰撞形狀時, 引擎的寬相位演算法可以丟棄不活躍的物理"
"體. 這個窄相只需考慮到活躍物體的形狀. 如果一個StaticBody有許多碰撞形狀, 那麼"
"寬相位就會失敗. 較慢的窄相位必須對每個形狀執行碰撞檢查."

msgid ""
"If you run into performance issues, you may have to make tradeoffs in terms "
"of accuracy. Most games out there don't have a 100% accurate collision. They "
"find creative ways to hide it or otherwise make it unnoticeable during "
"normal gameplay."
msgstr ""
"如果遇到性能問題, 您可能需要在準確性方面進行權衡. 大多數遊戲都沒有100%的精確"
"碰撞. 他們找到了一些創造性的方法來隱藏它, 或者在正常的遊戲中讓它變得不讓人注"
