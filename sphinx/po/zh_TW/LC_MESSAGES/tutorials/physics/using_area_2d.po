msgid "Using Area2D"
msgstr "使用 Area2D"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Godot offers a number of collision objects to provide both collision "
"detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project "
"can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if you "
"understand how each of them works and what their pros and cons are. In this "
"tutorial, we'll look at the :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` node and show some "
"examples of how it can be used."
msgstr ""
"Godot提供了許多碰撞物件來提供碰撞偵測和回應. 試圖決定為你的專案使用哪一個可能"
"會讓人感到困惑. 如果你瞭解它們各自的工作原理以及它們的優點和缺點, 你就可以避"
"免問題並簡化開發. 在本教學中, 我們將查看 :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` 節點, "
"並展示一些如何使用它的例子."

msgid ""
"This document assumes you're familiar with Godot's various physics bodies. "
"Please read :ref:`doc_physics_introduction` first."
msgstr ""
"本文假設你熟悉 Godot 中的各種物理體，否則請先閱讀 :ref:"
"`doc_physics_introduction` 。"

msgid "What is an area?"
msgstr "什麼是區域？"

msgid ""
"An Area2D defines a region of 2D space. In this space you can detect other :"
"ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` nodes overlapping, "
"entering, and exiting. Areas also allow for overriding local physics "
"properties. We'll explore each of these functions below."
msgstr ""
"Area2D定義了二維空間的區域. 在這個空間中, 您可以偵測到其他 :ref:"
"`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` 節點的重疊, 進入和退出. 區域"
"(Area)還允許覆蓋本地物理屬性. 我們將在下面討論這些功能中的每一個."

msgid "Area properties"
msgstr "Area 的屬性"

msgid "Areas have many properties you can use to customize their behavior."
msgstr "區域有許多屬性可用於自訂它們的行為."

msgid ""
"The ``Gravity``, ``Linear Damp``, and ``Angular Damp`` sections are used to "
"configure the area's physics override behavior. We'll look at how to use "
"those in the *Area influence* section below."
msgstr ""
"前八個屬性用於配置區域的物理覆蓋行為. 我們將在下面一節中介紹如何使用這些內容."

msgid ""
"``Monitoring`` and ``Monitorable`` are used to enable and disable the area."
msgstr "*Monitoring* 和 *Monitorable* 用於啟用和禁用該區域偵測."

msgid ""
"The ``Audio Bus`` section allows you to override audio in the area, for "
"example to apply an audio effect when the player moves through."
msgstr ""
"音訊匯流排 (Audio Bus) 部分, 允許重寫該區域內的音訊, 例如當玩家移動時的音訊效"
"果."

msgid ""
"Note that Area2D extends :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, "
"so it also provides properties inherited from that class. The ``Collision`` "
"section of ``CollisionObject2D`` is where you configure the area's collision "
"layer(s) and mask(s)."
msgstr ""
"請注意,Area2D擴充了 :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, 所以"
"它也提供了從該類繼承的屬性, 例如 ``input_pickable`` ."

msgid "Overlap detection"
msgstr "重疊偵測"

msgid ""
"Perhaps the most common use of Area2D nodes is for contact and overlap "
"detection. When you need to know that two objects have touched, but don't "
"need physical collision, you can use an area to notify you of the contact."
msgstr ""
"也許Area2D節點最常見的用途是用於觸碰和重疊偵測. 當需要知道兩個物體已經觸碰, "
"但不需要物理碰撞時, 可以使用一個區域來通知."

msgid ""
"For example, let's say we're making a coin for the player to pick up. The "
"coin is not a solid object - the player can't stand on it or push it - we "
"just want it to disappear when the player touches it."
msgstr ""
"例如, 要做一個硬幣讓玩家去撿. 硬幣並不是一個實心的物體, 玩家不能站在上面, 也"
"不能推它, 只是想讓它在玩家觸碰它的時候消失."

msgid "Here's the node setup for the coin:"
msgstr "這是硬幣節點的設定:"

msgid ""
"To detect the overlap, we'll connect the appropriate signal on the Area2D. "
"Which signal to use depends on the player's node type. If the player is "
"another area, use ``area_entered``. However, let's assume our player is a "
"``CharacterBody2D`` (and therefore a ``CollisionObject2D`` type), so we'll "
"connect the ``body_entered`` signal."
msgstr ""
"為了偵測重疊, 我們將在Area2d上連接相應的訊號, 使用哪個訊號取決於玩家的節點型"
"別. 如果玩家是另一個區域(Area2d), 就使用 ``area_entered`` . 然而假設玩家是一"
"個 ``KinematicBody2D`` (因此也是一個 ``CollisionObject2D`` 型別), 將連接 "
"``body_entered`` 訊號."

msgid ""
"If you're not familiar with using signals, see :ref:`doc_signals` for an "
"introduction."
msgstr "如果熟悉使用訊號, 請參閱 :ref:`doc_signals` 的介紹."

msgid "Now our player can collect the coins!"
msgstr "現在我們的遊戲角色可以收集硬幣了！"

msgid "Some other usage examples:"
msgstr "其他一些使用實例："

msgid ""
"Areas are great for bullets and other projectiles that hit and deal damage, "
"but don't need any other physics such as bouncing."
msgstr ""
"區域對於子彈和其他彈丸物體來說是非常好用, 它可以擊中並造成傷害, 但不需要其他"
"物理效果, 如彈跳."

msgid ""
"Use a large circular area around an enemy to define its \"detect\" radius. "
"When the player is outside the area, the enemy can't \"see\" it."
msgstr ""
"用敵人周圍的一個大圓圈區域設定為 \"探測\" 半徑, 當玩家在該區域外時, 敵人就無"
"法 \"看到\" 玩家."

msgid ""
"\"Security cameras\" - In a large level with multiple cameras, attach areas "
"to each camera and activate them when the player enters."
msgstr ""
"安保攝像頭 - 在有多個攝像頭的大型關卡中, 在每個攝像頭上附加區域(area), 並在玩"
"家進入時啟動它們."

msgid ""
"See the :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game` for an example of using Area2D in a "
"game."
msgstr "遊戲中使用 Area2D 的範例請參閱 :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`。"

msgid "Area influence"
msgstr "區域影響"

msgid ""
"The second major use for area nodes is to alter physics. By default, the "
"area won't do this, but you can enable this with the ``Space Override`` "
"property. When areas overlap, they are processed in ``Priority`` order "
"(higher priority areas are processed first). There are four options for "
"override:"
msgstr ""
"區域節點的第二個主要用途是改變物理效果。預設情況下，區域不會這樣做，但你可以"
"用 *空間覆蓋（Space Override）* 屬性啟用這個功能。當區域重疊時，它們會按照 *"
"優先順序（Priority）* 的順序進行處理（優先順序較高的區域會被優先處理）。覆蓋"
"有四個選項:"

msgid ""
"*Combine* - The area adds its values to what has been calculated so far."
msgstr "*合併(Combine)* - 該區域將其數值加到目前已計算的數值上."

msgid ""
"*Replace* - The area replaces physics properties, and lower priority areas "
"are ignored."
msgstr "*替換(Replace)* - 該區域替換物理屬性, 低優先順序區域被忽略."

msgid ""
"*Combine-Replace* - The area adds its gravity/damping values to whatever has "
"been calculated so far (in priority order), ignoring any lower priority "
"areas."
msgstr ""
"*合併-替換 (Combine-Replace)* - 該區域將其重力/阻尼值加到目前為止計算出的所有"
"數值上(按優先順序), 忽略任何較低優先順序的區域."

msgid ""
"*Replace-Combine* - The area replaces any gravity/damping calculated so far, "
"but keeps calculating the rest of the areas."
msgstr ""
"*替換-合併 (Replace-Combine)* - 該區域替換了目前為止計算的所有重力或阻尼, 但"
"繼續計算其餘區域."

msgid ""
"Using these properties, you can create very complex behavior with multiple "
"overlapping areas."
msgstr "使用這些屬性, 可以建立具有多個重疊區域的複雜行為."

msgid "The physics properties that can be overridden are:"
msgstr "可以重寫的物理屬性有:"

msgid "*Gravity* - Gravity's strength inside the area."
msgstr "*重力(Gravity)* - 區域內的重力強度."

msgid "*Gravity Direction* - This vector does not need to be normalized."
msgstr "*重力方向 (Gravity Direction)* - 此向量不需要正規化。"

msgid ""
"*Linear Damp* - How quickly objects stop moving - linear velocity lost per "
"second."
msgstr "*線性阻尼 (Linear Damp)* - 物體停止移動的速度-每秒損失的線速度."

msgid ""
"*Angular Damp* - How quickly objects stop spinning - angular velocity lost "
"per second."
msgstr "*角度阻尼 (Angular Damp)* - 物體停止旋轉的速度-每秒損失的角速度."

msgid "Point gravity"
msgstr "重力點"

msgid ""
"The ``Gravity Point`` property allows you to create an \"attractor\". "
"Gravity in the area will be calculated towards a point, given by the ``Point "
"Center`` property. Values are relative to the Area2D, so for example using "
"``(0, 0)`` will attract objects to the center of the area."
msgstr ""
"*重力點 (Gravity Point)* 屬性允許您建立一個 \"吸引器\" . 區域中的重力將按 *重"
"力向量 (Gravity Vec)* 屬性給出的點進行計算. 值是相對於Area2D而言的, 因此例如"
"使用 ``(0, 0)`` 將吸引物件到區域中心."

msgid "Examples"
msgstr "範例"

msgid ""
"The example project attached below has three areas demonstrating physics "
"override."
msgstr "以下所附中的範例專案包含三個區域, 它們說明了物理重寫."
