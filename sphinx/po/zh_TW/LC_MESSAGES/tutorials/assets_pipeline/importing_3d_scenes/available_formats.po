msgstr ""
"FBX，通過 Open Asset Import 函式庫提供支援。但，FBX 為專屬軟體，因此若工作流"

"textures are part of the object's material file."
msgstr ""
"glTF 二進位檔是三種方法中最小的一種。glTF 二進位檔包含 Blender 中設定的網格與"
"紋理。將 glTF 放入 Godot 後，紋理會變成物件材質檔的一部分。"

msgid ""
"glTF embedded files (``.gltf``) function the same way as binary files. They "
"don't provide extra functionality in Godot, and shouldn't be used since they "
"have a larger file size."
msgstr ""
"glTF 嵌入式檔案可以獲得與二進位檔案相同的結果。但在 Godot 中沒有提供額外的功"
"能，而且因為檔案大小比較大，所以也不建議使用。"

msgid ""
"There are two reasons to use glTF with the textures separate. One is to have "
"the scene description in a text based format and the binary data in a "
"separate binary file. This can be useful for version control if you want to "
"review changes in a text-based format. The second is you need the texture "
"files separate from the material file. If you don't need either of those, "
"glTF binary files are fine."
msgstr ""
"有兩種情況會需要將 glTF 與紋理分別匯入。其中一種情況是需要讓場景由純文字檔來"
"描述、讓二進位資料保存在獨立的二進位檔案中，這樣子便適用於版本控制系統，可以"
"用基於文字的格式來審閱改動。第二種情況是檔需要將紋理與材質檔分開的時候。若沒"
"有需要這兩種情況的話，則用 glTF 二進位檔即可。"

"The glTF import process first loads the glTF file's data into an in-memory "
"GLTFState class. This data is then used to generate a Godot scene. When "
"importing files at runtime, this scene can be directly added to the tree. "
"The export process is the reverse of this, a Godot scene is converted to a "

"By default, Blender has backface culling disabled on materials and will "
"export materials to match how they render in Blender. This means that "
"materials in Godot will have their cull mode set to **Disabled**. This can "
"decrease performance since backfaces will be rendered, even when they are "
"being culled by other faces. To resolve this, enable **Backface Culling** in "
"Blender's Materials tab, then export the scene to glTF again."
msgstr ""
"預設情況下，Blender 在材質上禁用背面剔除，匯出材質時配對其在 Blender 中的算繪"

"This allows you to iterate on your 3D scenes faster, as you can save the "

"When working with version control, this is also more efficient as you no "
