msgid ""
"To support different actor locomotion like crouching and crawling, a similar "
"map setup as supporting :ref:`doc_navigation_different_actor_types` is "
"required."
msgstr ""
"為了支援不同的演員運動，如蹲伏和爬行，需要一個與支援 :ref:`doc_navigation_ "
"different_actor_types` 類似的地圖設定。"

msgid ""
"Bake different navigation meshes with an appropriate height for crouched or "
"crawling actors so they can find paths through those narrow sections in your "
"game world."
msgstr ""
"為蹲伏或爬行的演員烘焙具有適當高度的不同導覽網格，以便他們可以找到穿過遊戲世"
"界中這些狹窄部分的路徑。"

msgid ""
"When an actor changes locomotion state, e.g. stands up, starts crouching or "
"crawling, query the appropriate map for a path."
msgstr ""
"當演員改變運動狀態時，例如站起來、開始蹲下或爬行，查詢適當的地圖以獲取路徑。"

msgid ""
"If the avoidance behavior should also change with the locomotion e.g. only "
"avoid while standing or only avoid other agents in the same locomotion "
"state, switch the actors's avoidance agent to another avoidance map with "
"each locomotion change."
msgstr ""
"如果迴避行為也應該隨著運動而變化，例如僅在站立時迴避或僅迴避處於相同運動狀態"
"的其他代理，則隨著每次運動變化將演員的迴避代理切換到另一個迴避地圖。"

msgid ""
"While a path query can be execute immediately for multiple maps, the "
"avoidance agent map switch will only take effect after the next server "
"synchronization."
msgstr ""
"雖然可以對多個地圖立即執行路徑查詢，但迴避代理地圖切換只有在下一次伺服器同步"
"後才會生效。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
