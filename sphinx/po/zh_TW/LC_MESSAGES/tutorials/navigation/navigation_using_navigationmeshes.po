"The navigation mesh baking is by default done on a background thread, so as "
"long as the platform supports threads, the actual baking is rarely the "
"source of any performance issues (assuming a reasonably sized and complex "
"geometry for runtime rebakes)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The common source for performance issues at runtime is the parsing step for "
"source geometry that involves nodes and the SceneTree. The SceneTree is not "
"thread-safe so all the nodes need to be parsed on the main thread. Some "
"nodes with a lot of data can be very heavy and slow to parse at runtime, e."
"g. a TileMap has one or more polygons for every single used cell and "
"TileMapLayer to parse. Nodes that hold meshes need to request the data from "
"the RenderingServer stalling the rendering in the process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To improve performance, use more optimized shapes, e.g. collision shapes "
"over detailed visual meshes, and merge and simplify as much geometry as "
"possible upfront. If nothing helps, don't parse the SceneTree and add the "
"source geometry procedural with scripts. If only pure data arrays are used "
"as source geometry, the entire baking process can be done on a background "
"thread."

msgid "Navigation mesh creates unintended holes in 2D."

msgid ""
"The navigation mesh baking in 2D is done by doing polygon clipping "
"operations based on outline paths. Polygons with \"holes\" are a necessary "
"evil to create more complex 2D polygons but can become unpredictable for "
"users with many complex shapes involved."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid any unexpected problems with polygon hole calculations, avoid "
"nesting any outlines inside other outlines of the same type (traversable / "
"obstruction). This includes the parsed shapes from nodes. E.g. placing a "
"smaller StaticBody2D shape inside a larger StaticBody2D shape can result in "
"the resulting polygon being flipped."
