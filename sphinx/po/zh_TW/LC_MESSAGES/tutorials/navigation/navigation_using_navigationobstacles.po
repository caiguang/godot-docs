msgid "Using NavigationObstacles"
msgstr "使用 NavigationObstacle"

msgid ""
"NavigationObstacles can be used either as static or dynamic obstacles to "
"affect avoidance controlled agents."
msgstr "導覽障礙物可以用作靜態或動態障礙物來影響迴避控制代理。"

msgid ""
"When used statically NavigationObstacles constrain avoidance controlled "
"agents outside or inside a polygon defined area."
msgstr "當靜態使用時，導覽障礙會限制多邊形定義區域外部或內部的迴避控制代理。"

msgid ""
"When used dynamically NavigationObstacles push away avoidance controlled "
"agents in a radius around them."
msgstr "當動態使用時，導覽障礙會推開其周圍半徑範圍內的迴避控制代理。"

msgid ""
"2D and 3D versions of NavigationObstacles nodes are available as :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle2D<class_NavigationObstacle2D>` and :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle3D<class_NavigationObstacle3D>`  respectively."
msgstr ""
"2D 和 3D 版本的 NavigationObstacles 節點分別可用作:ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle2D<class_NavigationObstacle2D>` 和:ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle3D<class_NavigationObstacle3D>`。"

msgid ""
"NavigationObstacles do not change or influence the pathfinding in any way. "
"NavigationObstacles only affect the avoidance velocities of agents "
"controlled by avoidance."
msgstr ""
"導覽障礙不會以任何方式改變或影響尋路。導覽障礙僅影響受迴避控制的代理的迴避速"
"度。"

msgid "Static obstacles"
msgstr "靜態形體。"

msgid ""
"A NavigationObstacle is considered static when its ``vertices`` property is "
"populated with an outline array of positions to form a polygon."
msgstr ""
"當 NavigationObstacle 的「vertices」屬性填入有位置的輪廓陣列以形成多邊形時，"
"該 NavigationObstacle 被認為是靜態的。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles act as hard do-not-cross boundaries for avoidance using "
"agents, e.g. similar to physics collision but for avoidance."
msgstr ""
"靜態障礙物充當硬性請勿跨越邊界，以使用代理進行迴避，例如類似於物理碰撞，但用"
"於迴避。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles define their boundaries with an array of outline "
"``vertices`` (positions), and in case of 3D with an additional ``height`` "
"property."
msgstr ""
"靜態障礙物使用一系列輪廓「頂點」（位置）定義其邊界，如果是 3D，則具有附加的"
"「高度」屬性。"

msgid "Static obstacles only work for agents that use the 2D avoidance mode."
msgstr "靜態障礙物僅適用於使用 2D 迴避模式的代理。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles define through winding order of the vertices if agents are "
"pushed out or sucked in."
msgstr "如果代理人被推出或吸入，靜態障礙物透過頂點的纏繞順序來定義。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles can not change their position. They can only be warped to a "
"new position and rebuild from scratch. Static obstacles as a result are ill-"
"suited for usages where the position is changed every frame as the constant "
"rebuild has a high performance cost."
msgstr ""
"靜態障礙物不能改變其位置。它們只能扭曲到新的位置並從頭開始重建。因此，靜態障"
"礙物不適合每影格位置都會改變的用途，因為不斷重建會產生很高的效能成本。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles that are warped to another position can not be predicted by "
"agents. This creates the risk of getting agents stuck should a static "
"obstacle be warped on top of agents."
msgstr ""
"代理無法預測扭曲到另一個位置的靜態障礙物。如果靜態障礙物扭曲到代理頂部，這就"
"會產生代理被卡住的風險。"

msgid ""
"When the 2D avoidance is used in 3D the y-axis of Vector3 vertices is "
"ignored. Instead, the global y-axis position of the obstacle is used as the "
"elevation level. Agents will ignore static obstacles in 3D that are below or "
"above them. This is automatically determined by global y-axis position of "
"both obstacle and agent as the elevation level as well as their respective "
"height properties."
msgstr ""
"當在 3D 中使用 2D 迴避時，Vector3 頂點的 y 軸將被忽略。相反，障礙物的全局 y "
"軸位置用作海拔高度。代理將忽略 3D 中低於或高於其的靜態障礙物。這是由障礙物和"
"代理的全局 y 軸位置自動確定為海拔高度以及它們各自的高度屬性。"

msgid "Dynamic obstacles"
msgstr "動態性"

msgid ""
"A NavigationObstacle is considered dynamic when its ``radius`` property is "
"greater than zero."
msgstr "NavigationObstacle 的 ``radius`` 屬性大於零時就會被認為是動態障礙物。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles act as a soft please-move-away-from-me object for "
"avoidance using agents, e.g. similar to how they avoid other agents."
msgstr ""
"對於啟用了避障的代理而言，動態障礙物就是一個“請離我遠點”的物件，類似於它們自"
"己躲避其他代理的行為。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles define their boundaries with a single ``radius`` for a 2D "
"circle, or in case of 3D avoidance a sphere shape."
msgstr "動態障礙物使用 ``radius`` 半徑來定義邊界，2D 中是圓形，3D 中是球形。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles can change their position every frame without additional "
"performance cost."
msgstr "動態障礙物每一影格都可以改變位置，不會有額外的性能開銷。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles with a set velocity can be predicted in their movement by "
"agents."
msgstr "動態障礙物設定速度後，其他代理就能夠預測移動。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles are not a reliable way to constrain agents in crowded or "
"narrow spaces."
msgstr "動態障礙物不適合用來將代理限制在擁擠、狹窄的空間中。"

msgid ""
"While both static and dynamic properties can be active at the same time on "
"the same obstacle this is not recommended for performance. Ideally when an "
"obstacle is moving the static vertices are removed and instead the radius "
"activated. When the obstacle reaches the new final position it should "
"gradually enlarge its radius to push all other agents away. With enough "
"created save space around the obstacle it should add the static vertices "
"again and remove the radius. This helps to avoid getting agents stuck in the "
"suddenly appearing static obstacle when the rebuild static boundary is "
"finished."
msgstr ""
"雖然障礙物可以同時啟動靜態和動態屬性，但是出於性能的考慮不建議這麼做。理想情"
"況下，障礙物移動時，應該把靜態頂點移除、啟動半徑。障礙物到達目的地後，應該逐"
"步增大半徑，將其他代理推開。在障礙物的周圍創造出足夠大的安全區域後，就應該把"
"靜態頂點新增回來、移除半徑。這樣就能夠避免重建靜態邊界後，代理因為靜態障礙物"
"的突然出現而被卡住。"

msgid ""
"Similar to agents the obstacles can make use of the ``avoidance_layers`` "
"bitmask. All agents with a matching bit on their own avoidance mask will "
"avoid the obstacle."
msgstr ""
"和代理類似，障礙物也能夠使用 ``avoidance_layers`` 位元遮罩。自身的避障遮罩中"
"與之存在配對位元的代理都會躲避這個障礙物。"

msgid "Procedual obstacles"
msgstr "程式性天空。"

msgid ""
"New obstacles can be created without a Node directly on the NavigationServer."
msgstr "可以不借助節點，直接在 NavigationServer 上新建障礙物。"

msgid ""
"Obstacles created with scripts require at least a ``map`` and a "
"``position``. For dynamic use a ``radius`` is required. For static use an "
"array of ``vertices`` is required."
msgstr ""
"使用腳本建立的障礙物至少需要有一個 ``map`` 和一個 ``position``。動態障礙物還"
"需要 ``radius``。靜態障礙物還需要 ``vertices`` 屬性。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
