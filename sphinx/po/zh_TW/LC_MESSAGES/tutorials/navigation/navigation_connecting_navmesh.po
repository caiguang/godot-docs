"Different NavigationMeshes are automatically merged by the NavigationServer "
"when at least two vertex positions of one edge exactly overlap."
msgstr ""
"當一邊的至少兩個頂點位置完全重疊時，導覽伺服器會自動合併不同的導覽網格。"

"To connect over arbitrary distances see :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_using_navigationlinks`."
msgstr "若要連接任意距離，請參閱 :ref:`doc_navigation_using_navigationlinks`。"

msgid ""
"The same is true for multiple NavigationPolygon resources. As long as their "
"outline points overlap exactly the NavigationServer will merge them. "
"NavigationPolygon outlines must be from different NavigationPolygon "
"resources to connect."
msgstr ""
"對於多個 NavigationPolygon 資源也是如此。只要它們的輪廓點完全重疊，導覽伺服器"
"就會合併它們。 NavigationPolygon 輪廓必須來自不同的 NavigationPolygon 資源才"
"能連接。"

msgid ""
"Overlapping or intersecting outlines on the same NavigationPolygon will fail "
"the navigation mesh creation. Overlapping or intersecting outlines from "
"different NavigationPolygons will often fail to create the navigation region "
"edge connections on the NavigationServer and should be avoided."
msgstr ""
"同一 NavigationPolygon 上的重疊或相交輪廓將導致導覽網格建立失敗。來自不同導覽"
"多邊形的重疊或相交輪廓通常無法在導覽伺服器上建立導覽區域邊緣連接，因此應避"
"免。"

msgid ""
"Exactly means exactly for the vertex position merge. Small float errors that "
"happen quite regularly with imported meshes will prevent a successful vertex "
"merge."
msgstr ""
"精確意味著精確地進行頂點位置合併。匯入的網格經常發生的小浮動錯誤將阻止成功的"
"頂點合併。"

"Alternatively navigation meshes are not merged but still considered as "
"**connected** by the NavigationServer when their edges are nearly parallel "
"and within distance to each other. The connection distance is defined by "
"the  ``edge_connection_margin`` for each navigation map. In many cases "
"navigation mesh edges cannot properly connect when they partly overlap. "
"Better avoid any navigation mesh overlap at all time for a consistent merge "
"behavior."
msgstr ""
"或者，當「NavigationMesh」的邊緣幾乎平行且彼此在一定距離內時，"
"「NavigationMesh」不會合併，但仍被導覽伺服器視為「連線」。連接距離由每個導覽"
"地圖的“edge_connection_margin”定義。在許多情況下，當導覽網格邊緣部分重疊時，"
"它們無法正確連接。最好始終避免任何導覽網格重疊，以獲得一致的合併行為。"

"If navigation debug is enabled and the NavigationServer active the "
"established navigation mesh connections will be visualized. See :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_debug_tools` for more info about navigation debug options."
msgstr ""
"如果啟用了導覽偵錯並且導覽伺服器處於活動狀態，則已建立的導覽網格連線將視覺"
"化。有關導覽偵錯選項的更多信息，請參閱 doc_navigation_debug_tools。"
