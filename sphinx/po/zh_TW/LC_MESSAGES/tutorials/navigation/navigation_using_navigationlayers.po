"NavigationLayers are an optional feature to further control which navigation "
"meshes are considered in a path query and which regions can be connected. "
"They work similar to how physics layers control collision between collision "
"objects or how visual layers control what is rendered to the Viewport."

"NavigationLayers 是一項可選功能，用於進一步控制在路徑查詢中考慮哪些導覽網格以"
"及可以連接哪些區域。它們的工作方式類似於物理層如何控制碰撞物件之間的碰撞或視"
"覺層如何控制算繪到視窗的內容。"

"NavigationLayers are a single ``int`` value that is used as a **bitmask**. "
"Many navigation related nodes have ``set_navigation_layer_value()`` and "
"``get_navigation_layer_value()`` functions to set and get a layer number "
"directly without the need for more complex bitwise operations."

"NavigationLayers 是用作「位元遮罩」的單一「int」值。許多導覽相關節點都有"
"「set_navigation_layer_value()」和「get_navigation_layer_value()」函式來直接"

"Changing navigation layers for path queries is a performance friendly "
"alternative to enabling / disabling entire navigation regions. Compared to "
"region changes a navigation path query with different navigation layers does "
"not trigger large scale updates on the NavigationServer."

"更改路徑查詢的導覽層是啟用/停用整個導覽區域的一種效能友善的替代方案。與區域變"
