"If you want to run a dedicated server for your project on a machine that "

"Since Godot 4.0, this can be done by running a Godot binary on any platform "
"with the ``--headless`` command line argument, or running a project exported "
"as dedicated server. You do not need to use a specialized server binary "
"anymore, unlike Godot 3.x."
msgstr ""
"從 Godot 4.0 開始，這可以透過在任何平台上使用「--headless」命令列參數來執行 "
"Godot 二進位檔案或執行匯出為專用伺服器的專案來完成。與 Godot 3.x 不同，您不再"
"需要使用專門的伺服器二進位。"

msgid "Editor versus export template"

msgstr ""
"可以在無頭模式下使用編輯器或匯出範本（偵錯或發布）二進位。您應該使用哪一種取"
"決於您的用例："

msgid ""
"**Export template:** Use this one for running dedicated servers. It does not "
"contain editor functionality, and is therefore smaller and more optimized."
msgstr ""
"**Server (伺服器)：** 用於在專用伺服器上執行。不包含編輯器的功能，因此比較"
"小，也更最佳化。"

msgid ""
"**Editor:** This binary contains editor functionality and is intended to be "
"used for exporting projects. This binary *can* be used to run dedicated "
"servers, but it's not recommended as it's larger and less optimized."
msgstr ""
"**Headless (無週邊)：** 包含編輯器功能的二進位檔，目的是用來匯出專案。該二進"
"位檔 **可以** 用來執行專用伺服器，但因為檔案比較大，也比較沒最佳化，所以不建"

msgid "Export approaches"
msgstr "匯出 Preset"

msgid "There are two ways to export a project for a server:"
msgstr "有兩種方法可以為伺服器匯出專案："

msgid ""
"Create a separate export preset for the platform that will host the server, "
"then export your project as usual."
msgstr ""
"建立 Linux/X11 匯出預設設定，並定義指向伺服器二進位檔的自定 Release 匯出樣"
"板，然後照往常一樣匯出專案即可。"

msgid ""
"Export a PCK file only, preferably for the platform that matches the "
"platform that will host the server. Place this PCK file in the same folder "
"as an export template binary, rename the binary to have the same name as the "
"PCK (minus the file extension), then run the binary."
msgstr ""
"僅匯出 PCK 檔案，最好是與將託管伺服器的平台相配對的平台。將此 PCK 檔案放在與"
"匯出範本二進位檔案相同的資料夾中，將二進位檔案重新命名為與 PCK 相同的名稱（減"
"去檔案副檔名），然後執行該二進位檔案。"

msgid ""
"Both methods should result in identical output. The rest of the page will "
"focus on the first approach."
msgstr "這兩種方法產生的結果都相同。下方說明了 PCK 檔的這個方法。"

msgid "See :ref:`doc_exporting_projects` for more information."
msgstr "更多資訊請參考 :ref:`doc_exporting_projects` 。"

msgid "Exporting a project for a dedicated server"
msgstr "為專用伺服器匯出"

msgid ""
"If you export a project as usual when targeting a server, you will notice "
"that the PCK file is just as large as for the client. This is because it "
"includes all resources, including those the server doesn't need (such as "
"texture data). Additionally, headless mode won't be automatically used; the "
"user will have to specify ``--headless`` to make sure no window spawns."
msgstr ""
"如果您在以伺服器為目標時照常匯出專案，您會注意到 PCK 檔案與客戶端一樣大。這是"
"因為它包含所有資源，包括伺服器不需要的資源（例如紋理資料）。此外，不會自動使"
"用無頭模式；使用者必須指定“--headless”以確保沒有視窗生成。"

msgid ""
"Many resources such as textures can be stripped from the PCK file to greatly "
"reduce its size. Godot offers a way to do this for textures and materials in "
"a way that preserves references in scene or resource files (built-in or "
"external)."
msgstr ""
"許多資源（例如紋理）可以從 PCK 檔案中剝離，以大大減少其大小。 Godot 提供了一"
"種對紋理和材質執行此操作的方法，可保留場景或資源檔案（內建或外部）中的參考。"

msgid ""
"To begin doing so, make sure you have a dedicated export preset for your "
"server, then select it, go to its **Resources** tab and change its export "
"mode:"
msgstr ""
"首先，請確保您的伺服器有專用的匯出預設，然後選擇它，轉到其**資源**標籤並更改"
"其匯出模式："

msgid ""
"Choosing the **Export as dedicated server** export mode in the export preset"
msgstr "在匯出預設中選擇 **匯出為專用伺服器** 匯出模式"

msgid ""
"When this export mode is chosen, the ``dedicated_server`` feature tag is "
"automatically added to the exported project."
msgstr "選擇此匯出模式後，「dedicated_server」功能標記將自動新增至匯出的專案。"

msgid ""
"If you do not wish to use this export mode but still want the feature tag, "
"you can write the name ``dedicated_server`` in the **Features** tab of the "
"export preset. This will also force ``--headless`` when running the exported "
"project."
msgstr ""
"如果您不想使用此匯出模式但仍需要功能標籤，則可以在匯出預設的 **功能** 標籤中"
"寫入名稱``dedicated_server``。當運作匯出的專案時，這也會強制“--headless”。"

msgid ""
"After selecting this export mode, you will be presented with a list of "
"resources in the project:"
msgstr "選擇此匯出模式後，您將看到專案中的資源列表："

msgid "Choosing resources to keep, keep with stripped visuals or remove"
msgstr "選擇要保留的資源、保留剝離的視覺效果或刪除"

msgid ""
"Ticking a box allows you to override options for the specified file or "
"folder. Checking boxes does **not** affect which files are exported; this is "
"done by the options selected for each checkbox instead."
msgstr ""
"勾選複選框可讓您覆寫指定檔案或資料夾的選項。複選框**不會**影響匯出哪些檔案；"
"這是透過為每個複選框選擇的選項來完成的。"

msgid ""
"Files within a checked folder will automatically use the parent's option by "
"default, which is indicated by the **(Inherited)** suffix for the option "
"name (and the option name being grayed out). To change the option for a file "
"whose option is currently inherited, you must tick the box next to it first."
msgstr ""
"預設情況下，選取資料夾中的檔案將自動使用父級選項，這由選項名稱的 "
"**(Inherited)** 後綴表示（並且選項名稱呈灰色）。若要變更目前繼承選項的檔案的"
"選項，必須先勾選該檔案旁的方塊。"

msgid ""
"**Strip Visuals:** Export this resource, with visual files (textures and "
"materials) replaced by placeholder classes. Placeholder classes store the "
"image size (as it's sometimes used to position elements in a 2D scene), but "
"nothing else."
msgstr ""
"**剝離視覺效果：** 匯出此資源，並將視覺檔案（紋理和材質）替換為佔位符類別。佔"
"位符類別儲存影像大小（因為它有時用於在 2D 場景中定位元素），但不儲存其他內"
"容。"

msgid "**Keep:** Export this resource as usual, with visual files interact."
msgstr "**保留：**照常匯出此資源，與視覺檔案互動。"

msgid ""
"**Remove:** The file is not included in the PCK. This is useful to ignore "
"scenes and resources that only the client needs. If you do so, make sure the "
"server doesn't reference these client-only scenes and resources in any way."
msgstr ""
"**刪除：** 該檔案不包含在 PCK 中。這對於忽略只有客戶端需要的場景和資源很有"
"用。如果這樣做，請確保伺服器不會以任何方式引用這些僅限客戶端的場景和資源。"

msgid ""
"The general recommendation is to use **Strip Visuals** whenever possible, "
"unless the server needs to access image data such as pixels' colors. For "
"example, if your server generates collision data based on an image's "
"contents, you need to use **Keep** for that particular image."
msgstr ""
"一般建議是盡可能使用**Strip Visuals**，除非伺服器需要存取影像資料（例如像素顏"
"色）。例如，如果您的伺服器根據圖像的內容產生碰撞資料，則您需要對該特定圖像使"
"用 **Keep**。"

msgid ""
"To check the file structure of your exported PCK, use the **Export PCK/ZIP..."
"** button with a ``.zip`` file extension, then open the resulting ZIP file "
"in a file manager."
msgstr ""
"若要檢查匯出的 PCK 的檔案結構，請使用帶有「.zip」檔案副檔名的「**匯出 PCK/"
"ZIP...**」按鈕，然後在檔案管理器中開啟產生的 ZIP 檔案。"

msgid ""
"Be careful when using the **Remove** mode, as scenes/resources that "
"reference a removed file will no longer be able to load successfully."
msgstr ""
"使用 **刪除** 模式時要小心，因為引用已刪除檔案的場景/資源將無法再成功載入。"

msgid ""
"If you wish to remove specific resources but make the scenes still be able "
"to load without them, you'll have to remove the reference in the scene file "
"and load the files to the nodes' properties using ``load()`` in a script. "
"This approach can be used to strip resources that Godot doesn't support "
"replacing with placeholders yet, such as audio."
msgstr ""
"如果您希望刪除特定資源但使場景在沒有它們的情況下仍然能夠加載，則必須刪除場景"
"檔案中的參考並使用「load()」中的「load()」將檔案載入到節點的屬性中。腳本。這"
"種方法可用於剝離 Godot 尚不支援用佔位符取代的資源，例如音訊。"

msgid ""
"Removing textures is often what makes the greatest impact on the PCK size, "
"so it is recommended to stick with **Strip Visuals** at first."
msgstr ""
"刪除紋理通常對 PCK 大小影響最大，因此建議先堅持使用 **Strip Visuals**。"

msgid ""
"With the above options used, a PCK for the client (which exports all "
"resources normally) will look as follows:"
msgstr "使用上面的選項後，使用者端的 PCK（正常匯出所有資源）是這樣的："

msgid "The PCK's file structure for the server will look as follows:"
msgstr "伺服器的 PCK 檔結構是這樣的："

msgid "Starting the dedicated server"
msgstr "開啟專用伺服器"

msgid ""
"If both your client and server are part of the same Godot project, you will "
"have to add a way to start the server directly using a command-line argument."
msgstr ""
"若使用者端與伺服器端都屬於相同的 Godot 專案，則必須要加上能直接以命令行參數來"

"If you :ref:`exported the project "
"<doc_exporting_for_dedicated_servers_exporting_project>` using the **Export "

"command line without having to export the project."
msgstr ""
"最好新增至少一個上述命令列參數來啟動伺服器，因為它可用於從命令列測試伺服器功"

msgid ""
"If your client and server are separate Godot projects, your server should "

"On Linux, to make your dedicated server restart after a crash or system "
"reboot, you can `create a systemd service <https://medium.com/@benmorel/"
"creating-a-linux-service-with-systemd-611b5c8b91d6>`__. This also lets you "
"view server logs in a more convenient fashion, with automatic log rotation "

msgstr ""
"在 Linux 中，請確保專用伺服器會在當機或系統重開機的時候重新啟動，可以 `建立 "

"with-systemd-611b5c8b91d6>`__ 。這樣也可以更方便地檢視伺服器紀錄，並且 "
"systemd 會提供自動紀錄切割 (log rotatioin)。"

msgid ""
"If you have experience with containers, you could also look into wrapping "
"your dedicated server in a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ container. "
"This way, it can be used more easily in an automatic scaling setup (which is "
"outside the scope of this tutorial)."
msgstr ""
"若有 Container 的使用經驗，也可以試試將專屬伺服器包裝在 `Docker <https://www."
