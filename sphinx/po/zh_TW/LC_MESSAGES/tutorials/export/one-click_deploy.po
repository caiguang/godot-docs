msgid "What is one-click deploy?"
msgstr "什麼是一鍵式部署？"

msgid ""
"One-click deploy is a feature that is available once a platform is properly "
"configured and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since things "
"can go wrong at many levels (platform may not be configured correctly, SDK "
"may be incorrectly installed, device may be improperly configured, etc.), "
"it's good to let the user know that it exists."
msgstr ""
"這個功能會在有正確配置平台且將支援的裝置連接到電腦上後彈出。由於很多地方都有"
"可能出問題 (平台可能未正確設定、可能沒正確安裝 SDK、裝置可能為正確設定…等)，"
"所以讓使用者知道有單鍵部署這功能存在也不錯。"

msgid ""
"After adding an Android export preset marked as Runnable, Godot can detect "
"when a USB device is connected to the computer and offer the user to "
"automatically export, install and run the project (in debug mode) on the "
"device. This feature is called *one-click deploy*."
msgstr ""
"有些平台 (在本文撰寫時，只有 Android) 可以在 USB 裝置連接到電腦上時自動偵測，"
"並提供使用者在該裝置上自動匯出、安裝與 (以除錯模式) 執行專案的功能，用業界的"
"流行語來說，就是「單鍵部署」。"

msgid ""
"One-click deploy is only available once you've added an export template "
"marked as **Runnable** in the Export dialog. You can mark several export "
"presets as runnable, but only one preset per platform may be marked as "
"runnable. If you mark a second preset in a given platform as runnable, the "
"other preset will no longer be marked as runnable."
msgstr ""
"在匯出對話方塊中新增匯出範本並標記為**可執行**後便可使用一鍵部署。你可以同時"
"將多個匯出預設項標記為可執行，但同一平臺被標記為可執行的只能有一個。如果你把"
"該平臺的第二個預設項標記為可執行，其它預設項的標記會被取消。"

msgid "Supported platforms"
msgstr "支援所有平台。"

msgid ""
"**Android:** Exports the project with debugging enabled and runs it on the "
"connected device."
msgstr "**Android:** 將在匯出專案時啟用除錯，並在連接的裝置上運作。"

msgid ""
"Make sure to follow the steps described in :ref:`doc_exporting_for_android`. "
"Otherwise, the one-click deploy button won't appear."
msgstr ""
"另外，在建置自定匯出樣板前，依然必須依照 :ref:`doc_exporting_for_android` 中"
"所提到的步驟進行。"

msgid ""
"If you have more than one device connected, Godot will ask you which device "
"the project should be exported to."
msgstr "如果你連接的裝置超過一台，Godot會詢問你想匯出專案到哪台裝置。"

msgid ""
"**HTML5:** Starts a local web server and runs the exported project by "
"opening the default web browser."
msgstr "**HTML5:** 將啟動本地網頁伺服器，並打開預設網頁瀏覽器運作匯出的專案。"

msgid "Support for more platforms such as iOS is planned."
msgstr "針對包含iOS在內的更多平臺的支援在計畫之中。"

msgid "Using one-click deploy"
msgstr "單鍵部署"

msgid ""
"If deploying to Android, enable developer mode on your mobile device then "
"enable USB debugging in the device's settings."
msgstr ""
"如果是部署到Android，請在你的移動裝置上打開開發者模式，然後在裝置設定中啟用"
"USB除錯。"

msgid ""
"After enabling USB debugging, connect the device to your PC using an USB "
"cable."
msgstr "打開USB除錯後，將裝置通過USB線連接到PC。"

msgid "For advanced users, it should also be possible to use wireless ADB."
msgstr "如果你是高級使用者，也可以使用無線ADB。"

msgid ""
"Make sure there is an export preset marked as **Runnable** for the target "
"platform (Android or HTML5)."
msgstr ""
"確認目標平臺（Android 或者 HTML5）有一個被標記為 **可執行** 的匯出預設項。"

msgid ""
"If everything is configured correctly and with no errors, platform-specific "
"icons will appear in the top-right corner of the editor."
msgstr "如果這些都配置正確並且沒有報告有錯，編輯器右上角會出現平臺對應的圖示。"

msgid "Click the button to export to the desired platform in one click."
msgstr "點擊該按鈕一鍵匯出到所需的平臺。"

"If you can't see the device in the list of devices when running the ``adb "
"devices`` command in a terminal, it will not be visible by Godot either. To "
"resolve this:"
msgstr ""
"如果你在命令列中運作 ``adb devices`` 時無法在裝置列表中看到該裝置，那麼 "
"Godot 就也無法看到。要解決這個問題："

msgid ""
"Check if USB debugging is enabled *and authorized on the device*. Try "
"unlocking your device and accepting the authorization prompt if you see any. "
"If you can't see this prompt, running ``adb devices`` on your PC should make "
"the authorization prompt appear on the device."
msgstr ""
"請檢查是否啟用了 USB *並在該裝置上授權*。請嘗試解鎖你的裝置，如果有任何授權的"
"彈框的話請接受。如果你沒有看到這樣的彈框，在 PC 上執行 ``adb devices`` 應該就"
"會在該裝置上彈出授權提示。"

msgid ""
"Try `revoking the debugging authorization <https://stackoverflow.com/"

"developer settings, then follow the steps again."
msgstr ""
"請嘗試在該裝置的開發者設定中`撤銷除錯授權 <https://stackoverflow.com/"
"questions/23081263/adb-android-device-unauthorized>`__，然後再重試這些步驟。"

msgid ""
"Try using USB debugging instead of wireless debugging or vice versa. "
"Sometimes, one of those can work better than the other."
msgstr ""
"請嘗試使用 USB 除錯而不是無線除錯，反之亦然。有時候換種方法就能更好地工作。"
