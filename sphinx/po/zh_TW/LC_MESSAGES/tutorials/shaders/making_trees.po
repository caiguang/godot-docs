"The aim is to not focus on the modeling techniques (there are plenty of "
"tutorials about that), but how to make them look good in Godot."
msgstr ""
"我們的目標不是專注於建模技術(關於這方面有很多教學), 而是如何讓它們在Godot中看"
"起來更好."

msgid "Start with a tree"
msgstr "從一棵樹開始"

msgid "I took this tree from SketchFab:"
msgstr "我從 SketchFab 上獲取了這棵樹："

msgid "and opened it in Blender."

"The first thing you may want to do is to use the vertex colors to paint how "
"much the tree will sway when there is wind. Just use the vertex color "
"painting tool of your favorite 3D modeling program and paint something like "
"this:"
msgstr ""
"您可能要做的第一件事就是用頂點的顏色來描繪當有風的時候樹會搖擺多少. 只需使用"
"您最喜歡的三維建模程式的頂點著色工具, 並繪製如下:"

msgid ""
"This is a bit exaggerated, but the idea is that color indicates how much "
"sway affects every part of the tree. This scale here represents it better:"
msgstr ""
"這有點誇張, 但這個想法是, 顏色表明了多少搖擺影響樹的每個部分. 這個比例尺更能"
"說明問題:"

msgid "Write a custom shader for the leaves"
msgstr "為葉子編寫自訂著色器"

msgid "This is an example of a shader for leaves:"
msgstr "這是一個簡單的樹葉著色器的範例:"

msgid ""
"This is a spatial shader. There is no front/back culling (so leaves can be "
"seen from both sides), and alpha prepass is used, so there are less depth "
"artifacts that result from using transparency (and leaves cast shadow). "
"Finally, for the sway effect, world coordinates are recommended, so the tree "
"can be duplicated, moved, etc. and it will still work together with other "
"trees."
msgstr ""
"這是一個空間著色器. 沒有前/後剔除(所以可以從兩邊看到葉子), 並且使用了alpha預"
"通道, 所以使用透明度(和葉子投射陰影)導致的深度偽影比較少. 最後, 對於搖擺的效"
"果, 推薦使用世界座標, 以使樹可以被複製, 移動等, 並且仍然可以和其他樹一起使用."

msgid ""
"Here, the texture is read, as well as a transmission color, which is used to "
"add some back-lighting to the leaves, simulating subsurface scattering."
msgstr ""
"在這裡, 紋理和透射顏色被讀取, 透射顏色被用來給葉子新增一些背光, 模擬地下散射."

msgid ""
"This is the code to create the sway of the leaves. It's basic (just uses a "
"sinewave multiplying by the time and axis position, but works well). Notice "
"that the strength is multiplied by the color. Every axis uses a different "
"small near 1.0 multiplication factor so axes don't appear in sync."
msgstr ""
"這是建立葉子擺動的程式碼. 它是基本的(只是使用正弦波乘以時間和軸的位置, 但工作"
"得很好). 注意, 強度乘以顏色. 每個軸使用不同的小的接近1.0的乘法係數, 所以軸不"
"同步出現."

msgid "Finally, all that's left is the fragment shader:"
msgstr "最後, 剩下的就是片段著色器了:"

msgid "And this is pretty much it."
msgstr "差不多就是這樣."

msgid ""
"The trunk shader is similar, except it does not write to the alpha channel "
"(thus no alpha prepass is needed) and does not require transmission to work. "
"Both shaders can be improved by adding normal mapping, AO and other maps."
msgstr ""
"主幹著色器是類似的, 除了它不寫到alpha通道(因此不需要alpha前置)和不需要傳輸工"
"作. 這兩個著色器都可以通過新增法線對應, AO和其他對應來改進."

msgid "Improving the shader"
msgstr "改進著色器"

"There are many more resources on how to do this that you can read. Now that "
"you know the basics, a recommended read is the chapter from GPU Gems3 about "
"how Crysis does this (focus mostly on the sway code, as many other "
"techniques shown there are obsolete):"
msgstr ""
"還有更多的資源可以做到這一點, 您可以閱讀. 現在您已經瞭解了基礎知識, 建議閱讀"
"GPU Gems3中關於Crysis如何做到這一點的章節(主要關注搖擺程式碼, 因為許多其他技"
"術都已經過時了):"
