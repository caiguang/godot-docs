"Traditionally, `cutout animation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Cutout_animation>`__ is a type of `stop motion animation <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion>`__ in which pieces of paper (or other thin "
"material) are cut into special shapes and arranged in two-dimensional "
"representations of characters and objects. Characters' bodies are usually "
"made out of several pieces. The pieces are arranged and photographed once "
"for each frame of the film. The animator moves and rotates the parts in "
"small increments between each shot to create the illusion of movement when "
"the images are played back quickly in sequence."
msgstr ""
"傳統意義上, `剪影動畫 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutout_animation>`__ 是"
"一種 `定格動畫 <https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/"
"%E5%AE%9A%E6%A0%BC%E5%8A%A8%E7%94%BB>`__ . 在剪影動畫中, 人們把紙片(或者其他"
"的薄材料)剪成特殊的形狀, 來組合成角色和物體的二維形象. 角色的身體通常是由幾個"
"元件組成的. 這些元件在動畫的每一影格中形成一種組合, 之後對其攝影. 動畫製作者"
"在兩次攝影之間將這些部分進行很小幅度的移動和旋轉, 這樣, 當這些攝影的畫面以很"
"快的速度連續依次播放時, 就可以造成這些角色和物體在連續運動的假像."

"IK stands for inverse kinematics. It's a convenient technique for animating "
"the position of hands, feet and other extremities of rigs like the one we've "
"made. Imagine you want to pose a character's foot in a specific position on "
"the ground. Without IK chains, each motion of the foot would require "
"rotating and positioning several other bones (the shin and the thigh at "
"least). This would be quite complex and lead to imprecise results. IK allows "
"us to move the foot directly while the shin and thigh self-adjust."
msgstr ""
"IK 是反向動力學（Inverse Kinematics）的縮寫，給手部、足部以及其它肢體的動畫帶"
"來便利。想像一下，您想要將角色的腳放在地面上的特定位置。如果沒有 IK 鏈，腳的"
"每次運動都需要旋轉和定位其他幾個骨骼（至少得涉及大腿及小腿）。這將非常複雜並"
"導致不精確的結果。"

msgid ""
"**IK chains in Godot currently work in the editor only**, not at runtime. "
"They are intended to ease the process of setting keyframes, and are not "
"currently useful for techniques like procedural animation."
msgstr ""
"**Godot 中的 IK 鏈目前僅在編輯器中工作**，而不是在運作時工作。它們旨在簡化設"
"定關鍵影格的過程，目前對於程式動畫等技術沒有用處。"

"To create an IK chain, select a chain of bones from endpoint to the base for "
"the chain. For example, to create an IK chain for the right leg, select the "
"following:"
msgstr ""
"要建立 IK 鏈，請選擇從端點到鏈基的骨骼鏈。例如，要為右腿建立一條 IK 鏈，選擇"
