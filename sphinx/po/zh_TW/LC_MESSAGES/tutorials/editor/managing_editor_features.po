msgid "Managing editor features"
msgstr "功能列表"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"In certain situations, it may be desirable to limit what features can be "
"used in the Godot editor. For example, a UI designer on a team who doesn't "
"need to see 3D features, or an educator slowly introducing features to "
"students. Godot has a built in system called \"feature profiles\" to do this."
msgstr ""
"某些情況下，我們可能會想要限制 Godot 編輯器所能使用的功能。例如，團隊中的 UI "
"設計師無需見到 3D 功能，而老師會想要逐步向學生介紹功能。Godot 內建的“功能配"
"置”系統可以實作這樣的需求。"

msgid ""
"With feature profiles, major features and nodes can be hidden from the "
"editor. This only hides parts of the interface and does not actually remove "
"support for these features, so scenes and scripts relying on those features "
"will still work fine. This also means feature profiles are not an "
"optimization technique. For information on how to optimize Godot see :ref:"
"`doc_performance`."
msgstr ""
"使用功能配置，主要的功能和節點都可以在編輯器中隱藏。只會隱藏部分介面，不會真"
"正移除對這些功能的支援，所以依賴於那些功能的場景和腳本仍然可以正常工作。這同"
"時也意味著，功能配置並不是一種優化技巧。要瞭解如何對 Godot 進行優化，請參閱 :"
"ref:`doc_optimization`。"

msgid "Creating a profile"
msgstr "建立內容"

msgid ""
"To manage editor features go to **Editor > Manage Editor Features**. This "
"will open the **Manage Editor Feature Profiles** window. By default there "
"will be no profile. Click on **Create Profile** and give it a name. You will "
"then see a list of all the features in the Godot editor."
msgstr ""
"要管理編輯器功能，請前往**編輯器 > 管理編輯器功能**。這樣就打開了**管理編輯器"
"功能配置**視窗。預設是沒有配置的。請點擊**建立配置文件**並為其命名。然後你就"
"會看到 Godot 編輯器中所有功能的列表了。"

msgid ""
"The first section allows major editor features to be removed, such as the 3D "
"editor or scripting editor. Below the main features is every class and node "
"in Godot, which can be disabled as well. Click on a node and all of its "
"properties and options will be listed in the **Extra Items** box, these can "
"all be individually disabled."
msgstr ""
"第一個部分可以移除主要的編輯器功能，比如 3D 編輯器或腳本編輯器。主要功能的下"
"方是 Godot 中的所有類，也可以禁用。點擊節點後，會在**額外專案**中列出其屬性和"
"選項，可以單獨禁用。"

msgid "Sharing a profile"
msgstr "使用檔案"

msgid ""
"To share profiles between editors click on the **Export** button. Save the "
"custom profile somewhere as a ``.profile`` file. To use this in another "
"editor open that editor's **Manage Editor Feature Profiles** window and "
"click import, then select the ``.profile`` file."
msgstr ""
"要在編輯器之間分享配置，請點擊**匯出**按鈕。請將自訂配置保存為 ``.profile`` "
"檔案。要在其他編輯器中使用，請打開其**管理編輯器配置**視窗並點擊匯入，然後選"
"擇該 ``.profile`` 檔案。"

msgid ""
"This process is potentially cumbersome however if a large amount of "
"computers need custom profiles. As an alternative, you can enable self-"
"contained mode for Godot, which allows putting all editor configuration in "
"the same folder as the editor binary. See :ref:"
"`doc_data_paths_self_contained_mode` for details."
msgstr ""
"如果大量電腦都需要自訂配置，這個過程可能會比較繁瑣。另一種辦法是啟用 Godot 的"
"自包含模式，可以將所有編輯器配置放在與編輯器二進位檔案同一資料夾中。詳情請參"
"閱 :ref:`doc_data_paths_self_contained_mode`。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
