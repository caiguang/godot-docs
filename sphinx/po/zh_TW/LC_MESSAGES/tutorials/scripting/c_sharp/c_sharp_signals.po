msgid "C# signals"
msgstr "C# 訊號"

msgid ""
"For a detailed explanation of signals in general, see the :ref:`doc_signals` "
"section in the step by step tutorial."
msgstr ""
"完整的 C# 例子請參考按部就班 :ref:`doc_scripting` 教學中的 **處理訊號** 一"
"節。"

msgid ""
"While it is still possible to use signals through the ``Connect``/"
"``Disconnect`` API, C# gives us a more idiomatic way to implement the :ref:"
"`observer pattern<doc_key_concepts_signals>`."
msgstr ""
"雖然仍然可以透過「Connect」/「Disconnect」 API 使用訊號，但 C# 為我們提供了一"
"種更慣用的方法來實作觀察者模式<doc_key_concepts_signals>`。"

msgid "Signals as C# events"
msgstr "訊號與屬性"

msgid ""
"To provide more type-safety, Godot signals are also all available through "
"`events <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/events-overview>`_. "
"You can handle these events, as any other event, with the ``+=`` and ``-=`` "
"operators."
msgstr ""
"為了提供更多的型別安全性，Godot 訊號也可以透過「事件 <https://learn."
"microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/events-overview>」_ 取得。您可以像處理任何"
"其他事件一樣使用“+=”和“-=”運算符來處理這些事件。"

msgid ""
"In addition, you can always access signal names associated with a node type "
"through its nested ``SignalName`` class. This is useful when, for example, "
"you want to await on a signal (see :ref:`doc_c_sharp_differences_await`)."
msgstr ""
"此外，您始終可以透過其巢狀的「SignalName」類別存取與節點型別關聯的訊號名稱。"
"例如，當您想要等待訊號時，這很有用（請參閱:ref:"
"`doc_c_sharp_differences_await`）。"

msgid ""
"While all engine signals connected as events are automatically disconnected "
"when nodes are freed, custom signals aren't. Meaning that: you will need to "
"manually disconnect (using ``-=``) all the custom signals you connected as "
"C# events (using ``+=``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Custom signals as C# events"
msgstr "自定訊號"

msgid ""
"To declare a custom event in your C# script, use the ``[Signal]`` attribute "
"on a public delegate type. Note that the name of this delegate needs to end "
"with ``EventHandler``."
msgstr ""
"若要在 C# 腳本中宣告自訂事件，請在公共委派型別上使用「[Signal]」屬性。請注"
"意，該委派的名稱需要以“EventHandler”結尾。"

msgid ""
"Once this is done, Godot will create the appropriate events automatically "
"behind the scenes. You can then use said events as you'd do for any other "
"Godot signal. Note that events are named using your delegate's name minus "
"the final ``EventHandler`` part."
msgstr ""
"一旦完成，Godot 將在幕後自動建立適當的事件。然後，您可以像處理任何其他 Godot "
"訊號一樣使用所述事件。請注意，事件是使用委派名稱減去最後的“EventHandler”部分"
"來命名的。"

msgid ""
"If you want to connect to these signals in the editor, you will need to "
"(re)build the project to see them appear."
msgstr ""
"如果您想在編輯器中連接到這些訊號，您將需要（重新）建置專案才能看到它們出現。"

msgid ""
"You can click the **Build** button in the upper-right corner of the editor "
"to do so."
msgstr "你可以使用右上角的按鈕來。"

msgid "Signal emission"
msgstr "訊號"

msgid ""
"To emit signals, use the ``EmitSignal`` method. Note that, as for signals "
"defined by the engine, your custom signal names are listed under the nested "
"``SignalName`` class."
msgstr ""
"若要發出訊號，請使用“EmitSignal”方法。請注意，對於引擎定義的訊號，您的自訂訊"
"號名稱會列在巢狀的“SignalName”類別下。"

msgid ""
"In contrast with other C# events, you cannot use ``Invoke`` to raise events "
"tied to Godot signals."
msgstr ""
"與其他 C# 事件相比，您不能使用「Invoke」來引發與 Godot 訊號相關的事件。"

msgid ""
"Signals support arguments of any :ref:`Variant-compatible "
"<doc_c_sharp_variant>` type."
msgstr "訊號支援任何與變體相容的 <doc_c_sharp_variant>` 型別的參數。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Consequently, any ``Node`` or ``RefCounted`` will be compatible "
"automatically, but custom data objects will need to inherit from "
"``GodotObject`` or one of its subclasses."
msgstr ""
"因此，任何「Node」或「Reference」都會自動相容，但自訂資料物件需要從"
"「GodotObject」或其子類別別之一繼承。"

msgid "Bound values"
msgstr "列舉值"

msgid ""
"Sometimes you'll want to bind values to a signal when the connection is "
"established, rather than (or in addition to) when the signal is emitted. To "
"do so, you can use an anonymous function like in the following example."
msgstr ""
"有時，您需要在建立連線時將值綁定到訊號，而不是在發出訊號時（或除此之外）。為"
"此，您可以使用匿名函式，如下例所示。"

msgid ""
"Here, the :ref:`Button.Pressed <class_BaseButton_signal_pressed>` signal do "
"not take any argument. But we want to use the same ``ModifyValue`` for both "
"the \"plus\" and \"minus\" buttons. So we bind the modifier value at the "
"time we're connecting the signals."
msgstr ""
"這裡，Button.Pressed <class_BaseButton_signal_pressed>` 訊號不帶任何參數。但"
"我們希望對「加號」和「減號」按鈕使用相同的「ModifyValue」 。因此，我們在連接"
"訊號時綁定修飾符值。"

msgid "Signal creation at runtime"
msgstr "運作時建立訊號"

msgid ""
"Finally, you can create custom signals directly while your game is running. "
"Use the ``AddUserSignal`` method for that. Be aware that it should be "
"executed before any use of said signals (either connecting to them or "
"emitting them). Also, note that signals created this way won't be visible "
"through the ``SignalName`` nested class."
msgstr ""
"最後，您可以在遊戲運作時直接建立自訂訊號。為此，請使用“AddUserSignal”方法。請"
"注意，應在使用所述訊號（連接到它們或發出它們）之前執行它。另請注意，以這種方"
"式建立的訊號將不會透過「SignalName」巢狀類別可見。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
