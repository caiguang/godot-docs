msgid "Pausing games and process mode"
msgstr "將更改推送 (Push) 到遠端"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"In most games it is desirable to, at some point, interrupt the game to do "
"something else, such as taking a break or changing options. Implementing a "
"fine-grained control for what can be paused (and what cannot) is a lot of "
"work, so a simple framework for pausing is provided in Godot."
msgstr ""
"在大多數遊戲中，或多或少都會希望能夠中斷遊戲去幹些別的，例如休息一下或者修改"
"選項。要非常細緻地控制哪些可以暫停（哪些不可以）實作起來非常麻煩，所以 Godot "
"提供了一個簡單的暫停框架。"

msgid "How pausing works"
msgstr "如何暫停工作"

msgid ""
"To pause the game the pause state must be set. This is done by assigning "
"``true`` to the :ref:`SceneTree.paused <class_SceneTree_property_paused>` "
"property:"
msgstr ""
"要將遊戲暫停，就必須設定暫停狀態。將 :ref:`SceneTree.paused "
"<class_SceneTree_property_paused>` 屬性賦值為 ``true`` 即可："

msgid ""
"Doing this will cause two things. First, 2D and 3D physics will be stopped "
"for all nodes. Second, the behavior of certain nodes will stop or start "
"depending on their process mode."
msgstr ""
"這樣做會導致兩件事。首先，所有節點的 2D 和 3D 物理都會停止。其次，根據處理模"
"式的不同，某些節點的行為會停止或者開始。"

msgid ""
"The physics servers can be made active while the game is paused by using "
"their ``set_active`` methods."
msgstr "遊戲暫停時，可以通過 ``set_active`` 方法啟動物理伺服器。"

msgid "Process Modes"
msgstr "處理"

msgid ""
"Each node in Godot has a \"Process Mode\" that defines when it processes. It "
"can be found and changed under a node's :ref:`Node <class_Node>` properties "
"in the inspector."
msgstr ""
"Godot 中的節點都有“Pause Mode”（暫停模式）定義它們應該在何時進行處理。可以在"
"屬性面板中 :ref:`Node <class_Node>` 的屬性裡找到並修改。"

msgid "You can also alter the property with code:"
msgstr "你也可以通過程式碼來修改該屬性："

msgid "This is what each mode tells a node to do:"
msgstr "各個模式對節點的要求是這樣的："

msgid ""
"**Inherit**: Process depending on the state of the parent, grandparent, etc. "
"The first parent that has a non-Inherit state."
msgstr ""
"**Inherit（繼承）** ：處理與否取決於父、祖父等等節點中第一個具有非 Inherit 狀"
"態的節點。"

msgid ""
"**Pausable**: Process the node (and its children in Inherit mode) only when "
"the game is not paused."
msgstr "**可暫停**：僅在遊戲未暫停時處理節點（及其繼承模式下的子節點）。"

msgid ""
"**WhenPaused**: Process the node (and its children in Inherit mode) *only* "
"when the game is paused."
msgstr "**WhenPaused**：*僅*當遊戲暫停時處理節點（及其處於繼承模式的子節點）。"

msgid ""
"**Always**: Process the node (and its children in Inherit mode) no matter "
"what. Paused or not, this node will process."
msgstr ""
"**Process（處理）** ：無條件處理節點（以及 Inherit 模式的子節點）。無論暫停與"
"否，該節點都會進行處理。"

msgid ""
"**Disabled**: The node (and its children in Inherit mode) will not process "
"at all."
msgstr "**禁用**：節點（及其繼承模式下的子節點）根本不會處理。"

msgid ""
"By default, all nodes have this property in the \"Inherit\" state. If the "
"parent is set to \"Inherit\", then the grandparent will be checked and so "
"on. If a state can't be found in any of the grandparents, the pause state in "
"SceneTree is used. This means that, by default, when the game is paused "
"every node will be paused. Several things happen when a node stops "
"processing."
msgstr ""
"預設情況下，所有節點的這個屬性都是“Inherit”狀態。如果父節點也是“Inherit”，那"
"麼就會去檢查祖父節點，以此類推。如果祖宗們都沒有更改過狀態，那麼就會使用 "
"SceneTree 的暫停狀態。也就是說，在遊戲暫停時預設所有節點都會被暫停下來。節點"
"停止處理時會發生不少事情。"

msgid ""
"The ``_process``, ``_physics_process``, ``_input``, and ``_input_event`` "
"functions will not be called. However signals still work and cause their "
"connected function to run, even if that function's script is attached to a "
"node that is not currently being processed."
msgstr ""
"``_process``、``_physics_process``、``_input``、``_input_event`` 函式都不會再"
"被呼叫。不過訊號仍然是正常工作的，因此它們連接的函式也會執行，即便該函式的腳"
"本是附加在暫停模式為“Stop”的節點上的。"

msgid ""
"Animation nodes will pause their current animation, audio nodes will pause "
"their current audio stream, and particles will pause. These resume "
"automatically when the game is no longer paused."
msgstr ""
"動畫節點會暫停它們的目前動畫，音訊節點會暫停它們的目前音訊流，粒子也會暫停。"
"遊戲不再暫停時，它們都會自動繼續運作。"

msgid ""
"It is important to note that even if a node is processing while the game is "
"paused physics will **NOT** work for it by default. As stated earlier this "
"is because the physics servers are turned off. The physics servers can be "
"made active while the game is paused by using their ``set_active`` methods."
msgstr ""
"請注意有一點非常重要，即便遊戲暫停時節點仍在進行處理，但物理預設是**無法**正"
"常工作的。如前文所述，這是因為物理伺服器會被關閉。遊戲暫停時，可以通過 "
"``set_active`` 方法啟動物理伺服器。"

msgstr "暫停場景"

msgid "Start by creating a button that will be used to pause the game."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Create a menu containing a close button, set the **Process Mode** of the "
"menu's root node to **When Paused**, then hide the menu. Since the process "
"mode is set to **When Paused** on the root node, all its children and "
"grandchildren will inherit that process mode. This way, all the nodes in the "
"menu will start processing when the game is paused."
msgstr ""
"這是一個暫停功能表的例子。建立一個彈框或者面板，裡面放上控制項，然後將其暫停"
"模式設為“Process”並隱藏。將暫停彈框根節點設為“Process”後，它的所有子孫節點都"
"會繼承該狀態。這樣，場景樹的這個分支就會在暫停時繼續工作。"

msgid ""
"Attach a script to the menu's root node, connect the pause button created "
"earlier to a new method in the script, and inside that method pause the game "
"and show the pause menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, connect the menu's close button to a new method in the script. "
"Inside that method, unpause the game and hide the pause menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "You should now have a working pause menu."
