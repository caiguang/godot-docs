"The GDScript warning system complements :ref:`static typing "
"<doc_gdscript_static_typing>` (but it can work without static typing too). "
"It's here to help you avoid mistakes that are hard to spot during "
"development, and that may lead to runtime errors."

"GDScript 警告系統可與 :ref:`靜態型別 <doc_gdscript_static_typing>` 互補 (但即"
"使不用靜態型別也能使用警告系統)。警告系統能幫助開發者避免一些在開發時期難以找"

"如果要在檔案中忽略特定的警告，可以插入使用 ``#warning-ignore:警告ID`` 這種格"

"Warnings won't prevent the game from running, but you can turn them into "
"errors if you'd like. This way your game won't compile unless you fix all "
