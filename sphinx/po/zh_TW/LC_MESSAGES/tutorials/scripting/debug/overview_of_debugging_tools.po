msgid ""
"This guide will give you an overview of the available debugging tools in the "
"engine."
msgstr "本指南將概述引擎中可用的除錯工具."

msgid ""
"Godot comes with a powerful debugger and profilers to track down bugs, "
"inspect your game at runtime, monitor essential metrics, and measure "
"performances. It also offers options to visualize collision boxes and "
"navigation polygons in the running game."
msgstr ""
"Godot自帶強大的除錯器和剖析器, 可以追蹤bug, 在運作時檢查你的遊戲, 監控重要指"
"標, 並測量性能. 它還提供了在運作遊戲中視覺化碰撞框和導覽多邊形的選項."

msgid ""
"Finally, you have options to debug the game running on a remote device and "
"to reload changes to your scenes or your code while the game is running."
msgstr ""
"最後, 你可以選擇除錯在遠端裝置上運作的遊戲, 並在遊戲運作時重新載入對你的場景"
"或程式碼的修改."

msgid ""
"Many of Godot's debugging tools are part of the Debugger panel, which you "
"can find information about in :ref:`doc_debugger_panel`."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的許多除錯工具都是“除錯器”面板的一部分，你可以在 :ref:"
"`doc_debugger_panel` 中找到相關資訊。"

msgid "Debug menu options"
msgstr "測試"

msgid ""
"There are a few common debug options you can toggle on or off when running "
"your game in the editor, which can help you in debugging your game."
msgstr ""
"在編輯器中運作遊戲時, 有幾個常見的除錯選項可以切換為開或關, 以幫助你除錯遊戲."

msgid "Here are the descriptions of the options:"
msgstr "下面是這些選項的說明："

msgid "Deploy with Remote Debug"
msgstr "部署並啟用遠端偵錯"

msgid ""
"When exporting and deploying, the resulting executable will attempt to "
"connect to the IP of your computer for debugging."
msgstr "當匯出和部署時, 產生的可執行檔將嘗試連接到你的電腦的IP上進行除錯."

msgid "Small Deploy with Network FS"
msgstr "使用網路檔案系統進行小型部署"

msgid ""
"This option speeds up testing for games with a large footprint on remote "
"devices."
msgstr "這個選項加快了在遠端裝置上進行大足跡遊戲的測試."

msgid ""
"When **Small Deploy with Network FS** is on, instead of exporting the full "
"game, deploying the game builds a minimal executable. The editor then "
"provides files from the project over the network."
msgstr ""
"當**使用網路檔案系統進行小型部署**開啟時，部署遊戲不是匯出整個遊戲，而是建立"
"一個最小的可執行檔。然後，編輯器通過網路提供專案中的檔。"

msgid ""
"Also, on Android, the game is deployed using the USB cable to speed up "
"deployment."
msgstr "另外，在 Android 系統上，遊戲採用 USB 線部署，加快部署速度。"

msgid "Sync Scene Changes"

"appears instantly. When used remotely on a device, this is more efficient "
"with the network filesystem."
msgstr ""
"使用此選項, 在運作時對編輯器中的場景所做的任何更改都會立即顯示. 當在裝置上遠"
"端使用時, 這對網路檔案系統來說更為有效."

msgid "Sync Script Changes"
msgstr "同步腳本改動"

msgid ""
"Any script that is saved will be reloaded on the running game. When used "
"remotely on a device, this is more efficient with the network filesystem."
msgstr ""
"任何被保存的腳本都會被重新載入到正在運作的遊戲上. 當在裝置上遠端使用時, 這對"
"網路檔案系統來說更有效率."

msgid "Script editor debug tools and options"
msgstr "腳本編輯器除錯工具和選項"

msgid ""
"The script editor has its own set of debug tools for use with breakpoints "
"and two options. The breakpoint tools can also be found in the **Debugger** "
"tab of the debugger."
msgstr ""
"腳本編輯器有自己的一套除錯工具，用於中斷點和兩個選項。中斷點工具也可以在除錯"
"器的**除錯器**分頁中找到。"

msgid ""
"You can create a breakpoint by clicking the gutter in the left of the script "
"editor (on the left of the line numbers). When hovering this gutter, you "
"will see a transparent red dot appearing, which turns into an opaque red dot "
"after the breakpoint is placed by clicking. Click the red dot again to "
"remove the breakpoint. Breakpoints created this way persist across editor "
"restarts, even if the script wasn't saved when exiting the editor."
msgstr ""
"您可以透過點選腳本編輯器左側的裝訂線（行號左側）來建立斷點。將滑鼠懸停在該排"
"水溝上時，您會看到出現一個透明的紅點，點擊放置斷點後，該紅點會變成不透明的紅"
"點。再次點選紅點即可刪除斷點。以這種方式建立的斷點在編輯器重新啟動後仍然存"
"在，即使退出編輯器時未儲存腳本也是如此。"

msgid ""
"You can also use the ``breakpoint`` keyword in GDScript to create a "
"breakpoint that is stored in the script itself. Unlike breakpoints created "
"by clicking in the gutter, this keyword-based breakpoint is persistent "
"across different machines when using version control."
msgstr ""
"您也可以使用 GDScript 中的「breakpoint」關鍵字來建立儲存在腳本本身中的斷點。"
"與透過點擊裝訂線建立的斷點不同，使用版本控制時，這種基於關鍵字的斷點在不同的"
"電腦上是持久的。"

msgid ""
"The **Break** button causes a break in the script like a breakpoint would. "

"been closed. The **Debug with External Editor** option lets you debug your "
"game with an external editor. This option is also accessible in **Editor "
"Settings > Debugger**."
msgstr ""

"in the script editor's gutter. This arrow indicates the line of code the "
"debugger broke on."
