msgstr "訊號"

msgid "Instancing with signals"
msgstr "產生實體與訊號"

msgid ""
"Signals provide a way to decouple game objects, allowing you to avoid "
"forcing a fixed arrangement of nodes. One sign that a signal might be called "
"for is when you find yourself using ``get_parent()``. Referring directly to "
"a node's parent means that you can't easily move that node to another "
"location in the scene tree. This can be especially problematic when you are "
"instancing objects at runtime and may want to place them in an arbitrary "
"location in the running scene tree."
msgstr ""
"訊號提供了一種解耦遊戲物件的方式, 讓你避免強行強制固定節點排列. 當使用 "
"``get_parent()`` 時, 你會發現可能需要呼叫訊號的一個旗標, 直接引用一個節點的父"
"節點意味著你不能輕易地將該節點移動到場景樹的另一個位置. 當你在運作時產生實體"
"物件, 並且可能想把它們放在運作中的場景樹的任意位置時, 這可能是個問題."

msgid "Below we'll consider an example of such a situation: firing bullets."
msgstr "下面我們將考慮這種情況的一個例子: 發射子彈."

msgid "Shooting example"
msgstr "射擊範例"

msgid ""
"Consider a player character that can rotate and shoot towards the mouse. "
"Every time the mouse button is clicked, we create an instance of the bullet "
"at the player's location. See :ref:`doc_instancing` for details."
msgstr ""
"考慮一個可以旋轉並向滑鼠射擊的玩家角色. 每次點擊滑鼠按鈕, 我們就在玩家的位置"
"建立一個子彈的實例. 詳見 :ref:`doc_instancing` ."

msgid ""
"We'll use an ``Area2D`` for the bullet, which moves in a straight line at a "
"given velocity:"
msgstr "我們用 ``Area2D`` 來表示子彈, 它以給定的速度直線運動:"

msgid ""
"However, if the bullets are added as children of the player, then they will "
"remain \"attached\" to the player as it rotates:"
msgstr ""
"然而, 如果子彈作為遊戲角色的子節點新增, 那麼當它旋轉時, 子彈將仍然保持 \"附著"
"\" 在遊戲角色身上:"

msgid ""
"Instead, we need the bullets to be independent of the player's movement - "
"once fired, they should continue traveling in a straight line and the player "
"can no longer affect them. Instead of being added to the scene tree as a "
"child of the player, it makes more sense to add the bullet as a child of the "
"\"main\" game scene, which may be the player's parent or even further up the "
"tree."
msgstr ""
"相反, 我們需要子彈獨立於遊戲角色的移動——一旦發射, 子彈將持續沿著直線運動, 遊"
"戲角色就不能再影響它們了. 與其作為遊戲角色的子節點被新增到場景樹中, 不如將子"
"彈作為 \"主\" 遊戲場景的子節點新增上去更有意義, 後者可能是遊戲角色的父節點, "
"甚至可能是更高層級的樹."

msgid "You could do this by adding the bullet to the main scene directly:"
msgstr "你可以通過將子彈直接新增到主場景中來做到這一點:"

msgid ""
"However, this will lead to a different problem. Now if you try to test your "
"\"Player\" scene independently, it will crash on shooting, because there is "
"no parent node to access. This makes it a lot harder to test your player "
"code independently and also means that if you decide to change your main "
"scene's node structure, the player's parent may no longer be the appropriate "
"node to receive the bullets."
msgstr ""
"然而, 這將導致一個不同的問題. 現在, 如果你試圖獨立測試你的 \"Player\" 場景, "
"它將在射擊時當機, 因為沒有父節點可以存取. 這使得獨立測試你的遊戲角色程式碼變"
"得更加困難, 也意味著如果你決定改變你的主場景的節點結構, 遊戲角色的父節點可能"
"不再是接收子彈的適當節點."

msgid ""
"The solution to this is to use a signal to \"emit\" the bullets from the "
"player. The player then has no need to \"know\" what happens to the bullets "
"after that - whatever node is connected to the signal can \"receive\" the "
"bullets and take the appropriate action to spawn them."
msgstr ""
"解決這個問題的方法是使用一個訊號來 \"發射\" 遊戲角色的子彈. 遊戲角色不需要 "
"\"知道\" 子彈在那之後發生了什麼——任何連接到訊號的節點都可以 \"接收\" 子彈並採"
"取適當的行動來產生它們."

msgid "Here is the code for the player using signals to emit the bullet:"
msgstr "下面是遊戲角色使用訊號發射子彈的程式碼:"

msgid ""
"In the main scene, we then connect the player's signal (it will appear in "
"the \"Node\" tab of the Inspector)"
msgstr "在主場景中，我們連接遊戲角色的訊號（它將出現在“節點”分頁中）"

msgid ""
"Now the bullets will maintain their own movement independent of the player's "
"rotation:"
msgstr "現在子彈將自行運作，獨立於遊戲角色的旋轉："
