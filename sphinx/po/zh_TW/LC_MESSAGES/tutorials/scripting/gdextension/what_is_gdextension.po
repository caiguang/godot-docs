msgid "What is GDExtension?"
msgstr "什麼是GDExtension？"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"**GDExtension** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine interact "
"with native `shared libraries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries>`__ at run-time. You can use it to run "
"native code without compiling it with the engine."
msgstr ""
"**GDExtension** 是 Godot 專有的技術，可以讓引擎在運作時與原生`共用庫 "
"<https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/"
"%E5%87%BD%E5%BC%8F%E5%BA%AB#%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB%E5%BA%93>`__互動。你可以通過它"
"來執行原生程式碼，無需和引擎一同編譯。"

msgid ""
"GDExtension is *not* a scripting language and has no relation to :ref:"
"`GDScript <doc_gdscript>`."
msgstr "GDExtension *不是*指令碼語言，與 :ref:`GDScript <doc_gdscript>` 無關。"

msgid "Differences between GDExtension and C++ modules"
msgstr "GDExtension 與 C++ 模組的區別"

msgid ""
"You can use both GDExtension and :ref:`C++ modules "
"<doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` to run C or C++ code in a Godot project."
msgstr ""
"支援將 :ref:`C++ 模組 <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` 靜態連結到引擎二進位檔中。"

msgid ""
"They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The "
"one you should choose depends on your needs."
msgstr "它們都可以用來將協力廠商庫集成進 Godot。選用哪一個取決於你的需求。"

msgid ""
"Our long-term goal is that GDExtensions targeting an earlier version of "
"Godot will work in later minor versions, but not vice-versa. For example, a "
"GDExtension targeting Godot 4.2 should work just fine in Godot 4.3, but one "
"targeting Godot 4.3 won't work in Godot 4.2."
msgstr ""
"我們的長期目標是針對早期版本 Godot 的 GDExtensions 將在以後的次要版本中工作，"
"但反之則不然。例如，針對 Godot 4.2 的 GDExtension 在 Godot 4.3 中應該可以正常"
"運作，但針對 Godot 4.3 的 GDExtension 在 Godot 4.2 中則無法運作。"

msgid ""
"However, GDExtension is currently *experimental*, which means that we may "
"break compatibility in order to fix major bugs or include critical features. "
"For example, GDExtensions created for Godot 4.0 aren't compatible with Godot "
"4.1 (see :ref:`updating_your_gdextension_for_godot_4_1`)."
msgstr ""
"然而，GDExtension 目前處於*實驗階段*，這意味著我們可能會破壞相容性以修復主要"
"錯誤或包含關鍵功能。例如，為 Godot 4.0 建立的 GDExtension 與 Godot 4.1 不相容"
"（請參閱:ref:`updating_your_gdextension_for_godot_4_1`）。"

msgid "Advantages of GDExtension"
msgstr "GDExtension 的優點"

msgid ""
"Unlike modules, GDExtension doesn't require compiling the engine's source "
"code, making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most "
"of the API available to GDScript and C#, allowing you to code game logic "
"with full control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-"
"performance code you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset "
"library <doc_what_is_assetlib>`."
msgstr ""
"與模組不同，GDNative 不需要編譯引擎的源碼，可以使你的作品更易於分發。它可以讓"
"你存取 GDScript、C# 使用的大多數 API，讓你在編寫遊戲邏輯時能夠完全控制性能。"
"這是你在:ref:`素材庫 <doc_what_is_assetlib>`中以外掛程式形式分發高性能程式碼"
"的理想選擇。"

msgid "Also:"
msgstr "並且："

msgid ""
"GDExtension is not limited to C and C++. Thanks to :ref:`third-party "
"bindings <doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, you can use it with "
"many other languages."
msgstr ""
"GDExtension 並不僅限於 C 和 C++。得益於:ref:`協力廠商綁定 "
"<doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`，你也可以在很多其他語言中使用。"

msgid ""
"You can use the same compiled GDExtension library in the editor and exported "
"project. With C++ modules, you have to recompile all the export templates "
"you plan to use if you require its functionality at run-time."
msgstr ""
"你可以在編輯器和匯出專案中使用相同的編譯後的 GDNative 庫。而對於 C++ 模組，如"
"果你想在運作時使用相關功能，就必須重新編譯所有想要使用的匯出範本。"

msgid ""
"GDExtension only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. "
"That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. "
"Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with "
"incremental builds, this process is slower than using GDExtension."
msgstr ""
"GDNative 只需編譯你自己的庫，而不是整個引擎。C++ 模組則與此不同，是會靜態編譯"
"進引擎的。每修改一次模組，你就需要重新編譯一次引擎。即使使用差異量建構，這一"
"過程也比 GDNative 要慢。"

msgid "Advantages of C++ modules"
msgstr "C++ 模組的優點"

msgid ""
"We recommend :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` in cases where "
"GDExtension isn't enough:"
msgstr ""
"支援將 :ref:`C++ 模組 <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` 靜態連結到引擎二進位檔中。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"C++ modules provide deeper integration into the engine. GDExtension's access "
"is not as deep as static modules."
msgstr "C++ 模組與引擎的集成更加緊密。GDExtension 對引擎的存取沒有靜態模組深入"

msgid ""
"You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without "
"carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."
msgstr ""
"使用 C++ 模組為專案提供額外功能，就可以免去攜帶原生庫檔的麻煩。同樣也適用於匯"
"出的專案。"

"If you notice that specific systems are not accessible via GDExtension but "
"are via custom modules, feel free to open an issue on the `godot-cpp "
"repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp>`__ to discuss "
"implementation options for exposing the missing functionality."

"There are no plans to support additional languages with GDExtension "
"officially. That said, the community offers several bindings for other "
"languages (see below)."

"GDExtension add-ons compiled for a given Godot version are only guaranteed "
"to work with the same minor release series. For example, a GDExtension add-"

"GDExtension add-ons are also only compatible with engine builds that use the "
