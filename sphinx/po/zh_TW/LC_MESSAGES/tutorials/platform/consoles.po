"In order to develop for consoles in Godot, you need access to the console "
"SDK and export templates for it. These export templates need to be developed "
"either by yourself or someone hired to do it, or provided by a third party "
"company."
msgstr ""
"為了在 Godot 中進行控制台開發，您需要存取控制台 SDK 並為其匯出範本。這些匯出"
"範本需要由您自己或僱用的人開發，或由第三方公司提供。"

msgid ""
"Currently, the only console Godot officially supports is Steam Deck (through "
"the official Linux export templates)."
msgstr ""
"目前，Godot 唯一官方支援的控制台是 Steam Deck（透過官方 Linux 匯出模板）。"

msgid "The reason other consoles are not officially supported are:"
msgstr "Godot 支援基於 Linux 的 Steam Deck。其他主機尚未獲得官方支援的原因有："

msgid ""
"To develop for consoles, one must be licensed as a company. As an open "
"source project, Godot has no legal structure to provide console ports."
msgstr ""
"要為遊戲機開發遊戲, 必須獲得公司許可. 作為一個開源專案,Godot沒有這樣的法律部"
"分."

msgid ""
"Console SDKs are secret and covered by non-disclosure agreements. Even if we "
"could get access to them, we could not publish the platform-specific code "
"under an open source license."
msgstr ""
"遊戲機的SDK是保密的, 並由保密協定保護. 即使我們可以存取它們, 我們也無法在開源"
"許可下發行特定平臺的程式碼."

msgid ""
"As explained, however, it is possible to port your games to consoles thanks "
"to services provided by third-party companies."
msgstr "但是，基於協力廠商公司提供的服務，仍然可以將遊戲移植到遊戲機中。"

msgid ""
"In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine. In "
"other words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to distribute "
"console export templates without requiring the user to prove that they are a "
"licensed console developer."
msgstr ""
"實際上，這個過程與 Unity 和虛幻引擎十分相似，只是你需要聯繫協力廠商開發者來處"
"理移植過程。換句話說，在法律上，沒有任何一個引擎可以在不要求使用者證明自己是"
"授權的遊戲機開發者的情況下發行遊戲機匯出範本。這樣做會違反遊戲主機製造商的 "
"NDA。"

msgid "Console publishing process"
msgstr "主機平臺發行流程"

msgid ""
"Regardless of the engine used to create the game, the process to publish a "
"game to a console platform is as follows:"
msgstr "無論使用哪種引擎製作遊戲, 將遊戲發行到遊戲主機平臺的流程如下:"

msgid ""
"Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then "
"sign NDAs and publishing contracts. This requires you to have a registered "
"legal entity."
msgstr ""
"在遊戲主機製造商的網站上註冊一個開發者帳號，然後簽署 NDA 和出版合同。這需要你"
"有一個註冊的法人實體。"

msgid ""
"Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. "
"This can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly "
"easier if an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is "
"generally known to be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not "
"guaranteed."
msgstr ""
"通過驗收程式, 獲得進入出版平臺的機會. 這可能需要長達幾個月的時間. 注意, 如果"
"有成熟的發行商支援你的遊戲, 這一步就會明顯容易很多. 眾所周知, 任天堂通常更接"
"受小型開發商, 但這並不保證."

msgid ""
"Get access to developer tools and order a console specially made for "
"developers (*devkit*). The cost of those devkits is confidential."
msgstr ""
"獲得使用開發者工具的許可權，並訂購專門為開發者製作的遊戲主機（*devkit*）。這"
"些 devkit 的費用是保密的。"

msgid "Port the engine to the console platform or pay a company to do it."
msgstr "把引擎移植到遊戲主機平臺上，或者花錢請一家公司來做。"

msgid ""
"To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to "
"sell it in. For example, game ratings are handled by `ESRB <https://www.esrb."
"org/>`__ in North America, and `PEGI <https://pegi.info/>`__ in Europe. "
"Indie developers can generally get a rating for cheaper compared to more "
"established developers."
msgstr ""
"要想出版，你的遊戲需要在你想銷售的地區進行評級。例如在北美，`ESRB <https://"
"www.esrb.org/>`__ 處理遊戲評級。在歐洲，這是由 `PEGI <https://pegi.info/>`__ "
"完成的。與更成熟的開發商相比，獨立開發商通常可以以更低的價格獲得評級。"

msgid ""
"Due to the complexity of the process, many studios and developers prefer to "
"outsource console porting."
msgstr "由於過程的複雜性，許多工作室和開發者更喜歡外包控制台移植。"
