msgid "Interpolation"
msgstr "插值"

msgid ""
"Interpolation is a very basic operation in graphics programming. It's good "
"to become familiar with it in order to expand your horizons as a graphics "
"developer."
msgstr ""
"插值是圖形程式設計中一個非常基本的操作. 作為一名圖形開發人員, 熟悉它有助於擴"
"充您的視野."

msgid ""
"The basic idea is that you want to transition from A to B. A value ``t``, "
"represents the states in-between."
msgstr "基本思想是從 A 轉換到 B。``t`` 值是介於兩者之間的狀態。"

msgid ""
"For example, if ``t`` is 0, then the state is A. If ``t`` is 1, then the "
"state is B. Anything in-between is an *interpolation*."
msgstr ""
"舉個例子, 如果 ``t`` 值為0, 那麼狀態是A. 如果 ``t`` 值是1, 狀態是B. 任何介於"
"兩者之間的都是 *插值*."

msgid ""
"Between two real (floating-point) numbers, an interpolation can be described "
"as:"
msgstr "在兩個實數(浮點數)之間, 一個簡單的插值通常描述為:"

msgid "And often simplified to:"
msgstr "通常簡化為:"

msgid ""
"The name of this type of interpolation, which transforms a value into "
"another at *constant speed* is *\"linear\"*. So, when you hear about *Linear "
"Interpolation*, you know they are referring to this formula."
msgstr ""
"這型別的插值名字, 將一個值以 *恒定速度* 轉換成另一個值 *\"線性\"*. 當你聽說線"
"性插值時, 就知道他們是指這個簡單的公式."

msgid ""
"There are other types of interpolations, which will not be covered here. A "
"recommended read afterwards is the :ref:`Bezier <doc_beziers_and_curves>` "
"page."
msgstr ""
"還有其他型別的插值, 這裡將不做討論. 建議之後閱讀 :ref:`Bezier "
"<doc_beziers_and_curves>` 頁面."

msgid "Vector interpolation"
msgstr "向量插值"

msgid ""
"Vector types (:ref:`Vector2 <class_Vector2>` and :ref:`Vector3 "
"<class_Vector3>`) can also be interpolated, they come with handy functions "
"to do it :ref:`Vector2.lerp() <class_Vector2_method_lerp>` and :ref:`Vector3."
"lerp() <class_Vector3_method_lerp>`."
msgstr ""
"向量型別 (:ref:`Vector2 <class_Vector2>` 和 :ref:`Vector3 <class_Vector3>`) "
"也可以插值, 它們提供了方便的函式來實作這一點 :ref:`Vector2."
"linear_interpolate() <class_Vector2_method_linear_interpolate>` 和 :ref:"
"`Vector3.linear_interpolate() <class_Vector3_method_linear_interpolate>`."

msgid ""
"For cubic interpolation, there are also :ref:`Vector2.cubic_interpolate() "
"<class_Vector2_method_cubic_interpolate>` and :ref:`Vector3."
"cubic_interpolate() <class_Vector3_method_cubic_interpolate>`, which do a :"
"ref:`Bezier <doc_beziers_and_curves>` style interpolation."
msgstr ""
"對於三次插值，還有 :ref:`Vector2.cubic_interpolate() "
"<class_Vector2_method_cubic_interpolate>` 和 :ref:`Vector3."
"cubic_interpolate() <class_Vector3_method_cubic_interpolate>` ，它們執行 :"
"ref:`Bezier <doc_beziers_and_curves>` 式插值。"

msgid ""
"Here is example pseudo-code for going from point A to B using interpolation:"
msgstr "下面是使用插值從A點到B點的簡單偽程式碼:"

msgid "It will produce the following motion:"
msgstr "它將產生以下運動:"

msgid "Transform interpolation"
msgstr "變換插值"

msgid ""
"It is also possible to interpolate whole transforms (make sure they have "
"either uniform scale or, at least, the same non-uniform scale). For this, "
"the function :ref:`Transform3D.interpolate_with() "
"<class_Transform3D_method_interpolate_with>` can be used."
msgstr ""
"也可以對整個變換進行插值（確保它們有均勻的縮放，或者至少有相同的非均勻縮"
"放）。對此，可以使用函式 :ref:`Transform.interpolate_with() "
"<class_Transform_method_interpolate_with>`。"

msgid ""
"Here is an example of transforming a monkey from Position1 to Position2:"
msgstr "下面是將猴子從位置1轉換為位置2的例子:"

msgid "Using the following pseudocode:"
msgstr "使用以下偽程式碼:"

msgid "And again, it will produce the following motion:"
msgstr "又會產生下面的動作:"

msgid "Smoothing motion"
msgstr "平滑運動"

msgid ""
"Interpolation can be used to smooth movement, rotation, etc. Here is an "
"example of a circle following the mouse using smoothed motion:"
msgstr "插值可用於平滑運動, 旋轉等. 下面是使用平滑運動跟隨滑鼠的圓圈的例子:"

msgid "Here is how it looks:"
msgstr "如下:"

msgid ""
"This useful for smoothing camera movement, allies following you (ensuring "
"they stay within a certain range), and many other common game patterns."
msgstr ""
"這對平滑相機運動很有用, 隊友在跟隨你(確保他們保持在一定範圍內), 以及許多其他"
"常見的遊戲模式."

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
