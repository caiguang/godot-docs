"Godot has nodes to draw sprites, polygons, particles, text, and many other "
"common game development needs. However, if you need something specific not "

"screen using custom commands."

"Godot 有用於繪製精靈、多邊形、粒子以及各種東西的節點。在大多數情況下，這就已"

"焦慮、憤怒……中哭泣。要知道，任何 2D 節點（不管它是繼承自 :ref:`Control "
"<class_Control>` 還是 :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>`）都可以很輕鬆地繪製自訂命"
