msgid ""
"The :ref:`ImmediateMesh <class_ImmediateMesh>` is a convenient tool to "
"create dynamic geometry using an OpenGL 1.x-style API. Which makes it both "
"approachable to use and efficient for meshes which need to be updated every "
"frame."

"Generating complex geometry (several thousand vertices) with this tool is "
"inefficient, even if it's done only once. Instead, it is designed to "
"generate simple geometry that changes every frame."
msgstr ""
"用這個節點生成複雜的幾何體(幾千個頂點), 即使只做一次, 效率也很低. 相反, 它的"
"設計是為了生成每一影格變化的簡單幾何體."

msgid ""
"First, you need to create a :ref:`MeshInstance3D <class_meshinstance3d>` and "
"add an :ref:`ImmediateMesh <class_ImmediateMesh>` to it in the Inspector."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, add a script to the MeshInstance3D. The code for the ImmediateMesh "
"should go in the ``_process()`` function if you want it to update each "
"frame, or in the ``_ready()`` function if you want to create the mesh once "
"and not update it. If you only generate a surface once, the ImmediateMesh is "
"just as efficient as any other kind of mesh as the generated mesh is cached "
"and reused."

msgid ""
"To begin generating geometry you must call ``surface_begin()``. "
"``surface_begin()`` takes a ``PrimitiveType`` as an argument. "
"``PrimitiveType`` instructs the GPU how to arrange the primitive based on "
"the vertices given whether it is triangles, lines, points, etc. A complete "
"list can be found under the :ref:`Mesh <class_mesh>` class reference page."
msgstr ""
"必須呼叫 ``begin()`` 才能開始生成幾何體 。``begin()`` 將一個 "
"``PrimitiveType`` 作為參數。``PrimitiveType``（像素型別）是 OpenGL 的概念，用"
"於指示 GPU 如何根據給定的頂點來安排像素，可以是三角形、線、點等。完整的列表可"
"以在 :ref:`Mesh <class_mesh>` 的類參考頁面中找到。"

msgid ""
"Once you have called ``surface_begin()`` you are ready to start adding "
"vertices. You add vertices one at a time. First you add vertex specific "
"attributes such as normals or UVs using ``surface_set_****()`` (e.g. "
"``surface_set_normal()``). Then you call ``surface_add_vertex()`` to add a "
"vertex with those attributes. For example:"
msgstr ""
"一旦你呼叫了 ``begin()`` , 就可以開始新增頂點了. 每次新增一個頂點, 首先使用 "
"``set_ **** ()`` 新增頂點的特定屬性, 如法線或UV(例如 ``set_normal()`` ). 然後"
"呼叫 ``add_vertex()`` 來新增一個帶有這些屬性的頂點. 例如 \"add_vertex()\" :"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Only attributes added before the call to ``surface_add_vertex()`` will be "
"included in that vertex. If you add an attribute twice before calling "
"``surface_add_vertex()``, only the second call will be used."
msgstr "只有在呼叫 ``add_vertex()`` 之前新增的屬性才會被包含在該頂點中."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Finally, once you have added all your vertices call ``surface_end()`` to "
"signal that you have finished generating the surface. You can call "
"``surface_begin()`` and ``surface_end()`` multiple times to generate "
"multiple surfaces for the mesh."
msgstr "最後, 當新增了所有的頂點後, 呼叫 ``end()`` 來表示已經完成了網格的生成."

msgid ""
"The example code below draws a single triangle in the ``_ready()`` function."
msgstr "下面的範例程式碼繪製了一個三角形."

msgid ""
"The ImmediateMesh can also be used across frames. Each time you call "
"``surface_begin()`` and ``surface_end()``, you are adding a new surface to "
"the ImmediateMesh. If you want to recreate the mesh from scratch each frame, "
"call ``surface_clear()`` before calling ``surface_begin()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above code will dynamically create and draw a single surface each frame."
