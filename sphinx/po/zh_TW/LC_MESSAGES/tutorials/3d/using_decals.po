"Sometimes, the fastest way to add texture detail to a scene is to use "
"decals. This is especially the case for organic detail, such as patches of "
"dirt or sand scattered on a large surface. Decals can help break up texture "
"repetition in scenes and make patterns look more natural. On a smaller "
"scale, decals can also be used to create detail variations for objects. For "
"example, decals can be used to add nuts and bolts on top of hard-surface "
"geometry."

msgid "Blob shadows"
msgstr "接觸陰影"

msgid ""
"Blob shadows are frequently used in mobile projects (or to follow a retro "
"art style), as real-time lighting tends to be too expensive on low-end "
"mobile devices. However, when relying on baked lightmaps with fully baked "
"lights, dynamic objects will not cast *any* shadow from those lights. This "

"平坦，動態物件幾乎看起來像是漂浮的。"

msgid ""
"Thanks to blob shadows, dynamic objects can still cast an approximative "
"shadow. Not only this helps with depth perception in the scene, but this can "
"also be a gameplay element, especially in 3D platformers. The blob shadow's "
"length can be extended to let the player know where they will land if they "
"fall straight down."
msgstr ""
"由於斑點陰影，動態物件仍然可以投射近似陰影。這不僅有助於場景中的深度感知，而"
"且還可以成為一種遊戲元素，尤其是在 3D 平台遊戲中。斑點陰影的長度可以延長，讓"
"玩家知道如果他們垂直落下他們會落在哪裡。"

msgid ""
"Even with real-time lighting, blob shadows can still be useful as a form of "
"ambient occlusion for situations where SSAO is too expensive or too unstable "
"due to its screen-space nature. For example, vehicles' underside shadows are "
"well-represented using blob shadows."
msgstr ""
"即使使用即時光照，斑點陰影仍然可以作為環境光遮擋的一種形式，適用於 SSAO 由於"

"If your decal is meant to affect static objects only, configure it to "
"prevent affecting dynamic objects (or vice versa). To do so, change the "

msgid "Textures"
msgstr "紋理"

msgid ""
"**Albedo:** The albedo (diffuse/color) map to use for the decal. In most "
"situations, this is the texture you want to set first. If using a normal or "
"ORM map, an albedo map *must* be set to provide an alpha channel. This alpha "
"channel will be used as a mask to determine how much the normal/ORM maps "
"will affect the underlying surface."
msgstr ""
"**反照率：** 用於裝飾的反照率（漫反射/顏色）貼圖。在大多數情況下，這是您要先"
"設定的紋理。如果使用法線或 ORM 貼圖，*必須*設定反照率貼圖以提供 Alpha 通道。"
"此 Alpha 通道將用作遮罩，以確定法線/ORM 貼圖對底層表面的影響程度。"

msgid ""
"**Normal:** The normal map to use for the decal. This can be used to "
"increase perceived detail on the decal by modifying how light reacts to it. "
"The impact of this texture is multiplied by the albedo texture's alpha "
"channel (but not **Albedo Mix**)."
msgstr ""
"**法線：** 用於裝飾的法線貼圖。這可用於透過修改光線對其的反應方式來增加裝飾上"
"的感知細節。此紋理的影響會乘以反照率紋理的 Alpha 通道（但不是 **反照率混合"
"**）。"

msgid ""
"**ORM:** The Occlusion/Roughness/Metallic map to use for the decal. This is "
"an optimized format for storing PBR material maps. Ambient Occlusion map is "
"stored in the red channel, roughness map in the green channel, metallic map "
"in the blue channel. The impact of this texture is multiplied by the albedo "
"texture's alpha channel (but not **Albedo Mix**)."
msgstr ""
"**ORM：** 用於裝飾的遮蔽/粗糙度/金屬貼圖。這是用於儲存 PBR 材質貼圖的最佳化格"

msgid ""
"**Emission:** The emission texture to use for the decal. Unlike **Albedo**, "
"this texture will appear to glow in the dark."
msgstr ""
"**發射：** 用於裝飾的發射紋理。與 **Albedo** 不同，此紋理看起來會在黑暗中發"

msgid "Parameters"
msgstr "參數"

msgid "**Emission Energy:** The brightness of the emission texture."
msgstr "**發射能量:** 發射紋理的亮度。"

msgid ""
"**Modulate:** Multiplies the color of the albedo and emission textures. Use "

"randomizing each decal's modulation)."
msgstr ""
"**調變：** 乘以反照率和發射紋理的顏色。使用它來為裝飾著色（例如，用於油漆裝"
"飾，或透過隨機化每個裝飾的調變來增加變化）。"

msgid ""
"**Albedo Mix:** The opacity of the albedo texture. Unlike using an albedo "
"texture with a more transparent alpha channel, decreasing this value below "
"``1.0`` does *not* reduce the impact of the normal/ORM texture on the "
"underlying surface. Set this to ``0.0`` when creating normal/ORM-only decals "
"such as footsteps or wet puddles."
msgstr ""
"**反照率混合：**反照率紋理的不透明度。與使用具有更透明 Alpha 通道的反照率紋理"
"不同，將此值降低到「1.0」以下並不會減少法線/ORM 紋理對底層表面的影響。當建立"
"普通/僅 ORM 裝飾（例如腳步或濕水坑）時，將其設定為「0.0」。"

msgid ""
"**Normal Fade:** Fades the Decal if the angle between the Decal's :abbr:"
"`AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)` and the target surface becomes too large. "
"A value of ``0.0`` projects the decal regardless of angle, while a value of "
"``0.999`` limits the decal to surfaces that are nearly perpendicular. "
"Setting **Normal Fade** to a value greater than ``0.0`` has a small "
"performance cost due to the added normal angle computations."
msgstr ""
"**正常淡入淡出：** 如果裝飾的 AABB（軸對齊邊界框）與目標表面之間的角度變得太"
"大，則淡出裝飾。無論角度如何，值“0.0”都會投影裝飾，而值“0.999”則將裝飾限制為"
"幾乎垂直的表面。由於增加了法線角度計算，將 **Normal Fade** 設定為大於「0.0」"
"的值會產生較小的效能成本。"

msgid "Vertical Fade"
msgstr "垂直淡化"

msgid ""
"**Upper Fade:** The curve over which the decal will fade as the surface gets "

msgstr ""
"**上部淡入淡出：** 隨著表面遠離 AABB（軸對齊邊界框）中心（朝向裝飾的投影"

msgstr ""
"**較低淡入淡出：** 當表面遠離 AABB（軸對齊邊界框）（遠離裝飾的投影角）中心"

msgid "Distance Fade"
msgstr "距離淡出"

msgid ""
"**Enabled:** Controls whether distance fade (a form of :abbr:`LOD (Level of "
"Detail)`) is enabled. The decal will fade out over **Begin + Length**, after "
"which it will be culled and not sent to the shader at all. Use this to "
"reduce the number of active decals in a scene and thus improve performance."
msgstr ""
"**啟用：** 控制是否啟用距離淡入淡出（LOD（細節等級）的一種形式）。裝飾將在 "
"**Begin + Length** 內淡出，之後它將被剔除並且根本不會發送到著色器。使用它可以"

msgid ""
"**Begin:** The distance from the camera at which the decal begins to fade "
"away (in 3D units)."
msgstr "**開始：** 裝飾開始淡出時距相機的距離（以 3D 單位表示）。"

msgid ""
"**Length:** The distance over which the decal fades (in 3D units). The decal "
"becomes slowly more transparent over this distance and is completely "
"invisible at the end. Higher values result in a smoother fade-out "
"transition, which is more suited when the camera moves fast."
msgstr ""
"**長度：** 裝飾褪色的距離（以 3D 單位表示）。裝飾在這段距離內逐漸變得透明，最"
"後完全不可見。數值越高，淡出過渡越平滑，這在相機快速移動時更適合。"

msgid "Cull Mask"
msgstr "剔除遮罩"

msgid ""
"**Cull Mask:** Specifies which VisualInstance3D layers this decal will "
"project on. By default, decals affect all layers. This is used so you can "
"specify which types of objects receive the decal and which do not. This is "
"especially useful so you can ensure that dynamic objects don't accidentally "
"receive a Decal intended for the terrain under them."
msgstr ""
"**剔除遮罩：** 指定此貼紙將投影到哪些 VisualInstance3D 圖層。預設情況下，裝飾"
"會影響所有圖層。使用它可以指定哪些型別的物件接收裝飾，哪些型別不接收裝飾。這"
"特別有用，因此您可以確保動態物件不會意外收到針對其下方地形的裝飾。"

msgid "Tweaking performance and quality"
msgstr "效能"

msgid ""
"Decal rendering performance is mostly determined by their screen coverage, "
"but also their number. In general, a few large decals that cover up most of "
"the screen will be more expensive to render than many small decals that are "
"scattered around."
msgstr ""
"裝飾算繪效能主要取決於其螢幕覆蓋範圍及其數量。一般來說，覆蓋大部分螢幕的一些"
"大裝飾的算繪成本會比散佈在各處的許多小裝飾的算繪成本更高。"

msgid ""
"To improve rendering performance, you can enable the **Distance Fade** "
"property as described above. This will make distant decals fade out when "
"they are far away from the camera (and may have little to no impact on the "
"final scene rendering). Using node groups, you can also prevent non-"
"essential decorative decals from spawning based on user configuration."
msgstr ""
"若要提高算繪效能，您可以如上所述啟用 **距離淡入淡出** 屬性。這將使遠處的裝飾"
"在遠離相機時淡出（並且可能對最終場景算繪幾乎沒有影響）。使用節點群組，您還可"
"以根據使用者配置防止產生非必要的裝飾裝飾。"

msgid ""
"The way decals are rendered also has an impact on performance. The "
"**Rendering > Textures > Decals > Filter** advanced project setting lets you "
"control how decal textures should be filtered. **Nearest/Linear** does not "
"use mipmaps. However, decals will look grainy at a distance. **Nearest/"
"Linear Mipmaps** will look smoother at a distance, but decals will look "
