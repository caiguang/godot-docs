msgstr ""
"如果您只需要網格在距離上變得不那麼詳細，但沒有手動建立 LOD 網格，請考慮依賴自"

"Note that automatic mesh LOD and visibility ranges can be used at the same "
"time, even on the same mesh."
msgstr "請注意，即使在同一網格上，也可以同時使用自動網格 LOD 和可見性範圍。"

msgid "How it works"
msgstr "它的運作方式"

msgid ""
"Visibility ranges can be used with any node that inherits from "
"GeometryInstance3D. This means they can be used not only with MeshInstance3D "
"and MultiMeshInstance3D for artist-controlled :abbr:`HLOD (Hierarchical "
"Level of Detail)`, but also GPUParticles3D, CPUParticles3D, Label3D, "
"Sprite3D, AnimatedSprite3D and CSGShape3D."
msgstr ""
"可見性範圍可與繼承自 GeometryInstance3D 的任何節點一起使用。這意味著它們不僅"
"可以與 MeshInstance3D 和 MultiMeshInstance3D 一起使用以實作藝術家控制的 HLOD"
"（層次化細節層級），還可以與 GPUParticles3D、CPUParticles3D、Label3D、"
"Sprite3D、AnimatedSprite3D 和 CSGShape3D 一起使用。"

msgid ""
"Since visibility ranges are configured on a per-node basis, this makes it "
"possible to use different node types as part of a :abbr:`LOD (Level of "
"Detail)` system. For example, you could display a MeshInstance3D "
"representing a tree when up close, and replace it with a Sprite3D impostor "
"in the distance to improve performance."
msgstr ""
"由於可見性範圍是基於每個節點配置的，因此可以使用不同的節點型別作為 LOD（細節"
"層級）系統的一部分。例如，您可以在近距離時顯示代表一棵樹的 MeshInstance3D，並"
"在遠處將其替換為 Sprite3D 冒名頂替者，以提高效能。"

msgid ""
"The benefit of :abbr:`HLOD (Hierarchical Level of Detail)` over a "
"traditional :abbr:`LOD (Level of Detail)` system is its hierarchical nature. "
"A single larger mesh can replace several smaller meshes, so that the number "
"of draw calls can be reduced at a distance, but culling opportunities can be "
"preserved when up close. For example, you can have a group of houses that "
"uses individual MeshInstance3D nodes (one for each house) when up close, but "
"turns into a single MeshInstance3D that represents a less detailed group of "
"houses (or use a MultiMeshInstance3D)."
msgstr ""
"HLOD（詳細層次層次）相對於傳統 LOD（詳細層次）系統的優點在於其層次性質。單一"
"較大的網格可以替換多個較小的網格，因此可以減少遠處的繪製呼叫數量，但可以在近"
"距離時保留剔除機會。例如，您可以擁有一組房屋，它們在近距離時使用單獨的 "
"MeshInstance3D 節點（每個房屋一個），但會變成表示一組不太詳細的房屋的單一 "
"MeshInstance3D（或使用 MultiMeshInstance3D）。"

msgid ""
"Lastly, visibility ranges can also be used to fade certain objects entirely "
"when the camera gets too close or too far. This can be used for gameplay "
"purposes, but also to reduce visual clutter. For example, Label3D nodes can "
"be faded using visibility ranges when they're too far away to be readable or "
"relevant to the player."
msgstr ""
"最後，當相機太近或太遠時，可見範圍也可用於使某些物件完全褪色。這可以用於遊戲"
"目的，也可以減少視覺混亂。例如，當 Label3D 節點離玩家太遠而無法讀取或與玩家相"
"關時，可以使用可見範圍進行淡入淡出。"

"This is a quick-start guide for configuring a basic LOD system. After "
"following this guide, this LOD system will display a SphereMesh when up "
"close and a BoxMesh when the camera is far away enough. A small hysteresis "

"properties. This prevents LODs from popping back and forth too quickly when "
"the camera is moving at the \"edge\" of the LOD transition."
