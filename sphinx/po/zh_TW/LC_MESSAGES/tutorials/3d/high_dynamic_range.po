"Normally, an artist does all the 3D modeling, then all the texturing, looks "
"at their awesome looking model in the 3D modeling software and says \"looks "
"fantastic, ready for integration!\" then goes into the game, lighting is "
"setup and the game runs."
msgstr ""
"通常情況下，藝術家會進行所有 3D 建模，然後進行所有紋理處理，在 3D DCC 中查看"

"So at what point does all this \"HDR\" business come into play? To "
"understand the answer, we need to look at how displays behave."
msgstr ""
"那麼, 所有這些\" HDR\"業務在什麼時候發揮作用？要理解答案, 我們需要查看顯示器"

"Your display outputs linear light ratios from some maximum to some minimum "
"intensity. Modern game engines perform complex math on linear light values "
"in their respective scenes. So what's the problem?"
msgstr ""
"您的顯示器輸出線性光比率從某個最大強度到某個最小強度. 現代遊戲引擎在各自的場"
"景中對線性光值進行複雜的數學計算. 這將會有什麼問題呢？"

msgid ""
"The display has a limited range of intensity, depending on the display type. "
"The game engine renders to an unlimited range of intensity values, however. "
"While \"maximum intensity\" means something to an sRGB display, it has no "
"bearing in the game engine; there is only a potentially infinitely wide "
"range of intensity values generated per frame of rendering."
msgstr ""
"根據顯示器型別的不同, 顯示的強度範圍有限. 然而, 遊戲引擎算繪的強度值範圍沒有"
"限制. 雖然 \"最大強度\" 對sRGB顯示器來說有一定的意義, 但在遊戲引擎中卻沒有任"
"何影響；每影格算繪時可能產生無限寬的強度值範圍."

msgid ""
"This means that some transformation of the scene light intensity, also known "
"as *scene-referred* light ratios, need to be transformed and mapped to fit "
"within the particular output range of the chosen display. This can be most "
"easily understood if we consider virtually photographing our game engine "
"scene through a virtual camera. Here, our virtual camera would apply a "
"particular camera rendering transform to the scene data, and the output "
"would be ready for display on a particular display type."
msgstr ""
"這意味著場景光強，也稱為*場景對應*（scene-referred）的光照比率，需要進行轉換"
"和對應以適應所選顯示器的特定輸出範圍。這就類似通過虛擬相機拍攝我們的遊戲引擎"
"場景，在這裡，我們的虛擬相機將對場景資料應用特定的相機算繪變換，其輸出將以特"
"定的顯示型別顯示。"

msgid ""
"Godot does not support high dynamic range *output* yet. It can only perform "
"lighting in HDR and tonemap the result to a low dynamic range image."
msgstr ""
"Godot目前尚不支援高動態範圍 *輸出*. 它只能在HDR中執行照明, 並將結果對應為低動"
"態範圍的圖像."

msgid ""
"For advanced users, it is still possible to get a non-tonemapped image of "
"the viewport with full HDR data, which can then be saved to an OpenEXR file."
msgstr ""
"對於高級使用者來說, 仍然可以得到一個非色調對應的視圖圖像與完整的HDR資料, 然後"
"可以保存到一個OpenEXR檔."

msgid ""
"Almost all displays require a nonlinear encoding for the code values sent to "
"them. The display in turn, using its unique transfer characteristic, "
"\"decodes\" the code value into linear light ratios of output, and projects "
"the ratios out of the uniquely colored lights at each reddish, greenish, and "
"blueish emission site."
msgstr ""
"幾乎所有顯示器都需要對發送給它們的程式碼值進行非線性編碼. 顯示器又利用其獨特"
"的傳輸功能, 將程式碼值 \"解碼\" 為輸出的線性光比, 並在每個紅色, 綠色和藍色發"
"射點的獨特顏色的光中投射出這些比值."

msgid ""
"For a majority of computer displays, the specifications of the display are "
"outlined in accordance with IEC 61966-2-1, also known as the 1996 sRGB "
"specification. This specification outlines how an sRGB display is to behave, "
"including the color of the lights in the LED pixels as well as the transfer "
"characteristics of the input (OETF) and output (EOTF)."
msgstr ""
"對於大多數電腦顯示器來說，顯示器的規格是根據 IEC 61966-2-1，即 1996 年的 "
"sRGB 規格，進行概述的。該規範概述了 sRGB 顯示器的性能，包括 LED 像素中的燈光"
"顏色以及輸入（OETF）和輸出（EOTF）的傳輸功能。"

msgid ""
"Not all displays use the same OETF and EOTF as a computer display. For "
"example, television broadcast displays use the BT.1886 EOTF. However, Godot "
"currently only supports sRGB displays."
msgstr ""
"並非所有顯示器都使用與電腦顯示器相同的OETF和EOTF. 例如, 電視廣播顯示器使用"
"BT.1886 EOTF. 然而,Godot目前只支援sRGB顯示器."

msgid ""
"The sRGB standard is based around the nonlinear relationship between the "
"current to light output of common desktop computing CRT displays."
msgstr ""
"sRGB標準是圍繞著常見的桌面計算CRT顯示器的電流與光輸出之間的非線性關係而制定"
"的."

msgid ""
"The mathematics of a scene-referred model require that we multiply the scene "
"by different values to adjust the intensities and exposure to different "
"light ranges. The transfer function of the display can't appropriately "
"render the wider dynamic range of the game engine's scene output using the "
"simple transfer function of the display. A more complex approach to encoding "
"is required."
msgstr ""
"場景參考模型的數學要求我們將場景乘以不同的值, 以調整不同光照範圍的強度和曝"
"光. 顯示器簡單的傳遞函式不能恰當地算繪遊戲從引擎場景中輸出的更大動態範圍. 這"
"需要一種更複雜的編碼方法."

msgid "Scene linear & asset pipelines"
msgstr "場景線性和資源管道"

msgid ""
"Working in scene-linear sRGB is more complex than pressing a single switch. "
"First, imported image assets must be converted to linear light ratios on "
"import. Even when linearized, those assets may not be perfectly well-suited "
"for use as textures, depending on how they were generated."
msgstr ""
"在場景線性sRGB中工作並不像按一下開關那樣簡單. 首先, 匯入的圖像素材必須在匯入"
"時轉換為線性光比例. 即使將其線性化, 這些素材也可能並不完全適合用作紋理, 具體"
"取決於它們的生成方式."

msgstr "Godot 沒有使用限制"

msgid "sRGB transfer function to display linear ratios on image import"
msgstr "用於在圖像匯入時顯示線性比率的sRGB傳遞函式"

msgid ""
"This is the easiest method of using sRGB assets, but it's not the most "
"ideal. One issue with this is loss of quality. Using 8 bits per channel to "
"represent linear light ratios is not sufficient to quantize the values "
"correctly. These textures may also be compressed later, which can exacerbate "
"the problem."
msgstr ""
"這是最簡單的使用sRGB資源的方法, 但不是最理想的. 這樣做的一個問題是品質的損"
"失. 每通道使用8位元來表示線性光比率, 不足以正確量化這些值. 這些紋理以後也可能"
"會被壓縮, 可能會加劇這個問題."

msgid "Hardware sRGB transfer function to display linear conversion"
msgstr "硬體sRGB傳輸函式顯示線性轉換"

msgid ""
"The GPU will do the conversion after reading the texel using floating-point. "
"This works fine on PC and consoles, but most mobile devices don't support "
"it, or they don't support it on compressed texture formats (iOS for example)."
msgstr ""
"GPU 會在使用浮點讀取紋素後進行轉換。這在 PC 和遊戲主機上很好用，但大多數移動"

msgid "Scene linear to display-referred nonlinear"
msgstr "場景線性到顯示參考的非線性"

msgid ""
"After all the rendering is done, the scene linear render requires "
"transforming to a suitable output such as an sRGB display. To do this, "
"enable sRGB conversion in the current :ref:`Environment <class_Environment>` "

msgstr ""
"完成所有算繪後, 場景線性算繪需要轉換為適當的輸出, 例如sRGB顯示. 為此, 請在目"

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that the **sRGB -> Display Linear** and **Display Linear -> "
"sRGB** conversions must always be **both** enabled. Failing to enable one of "
"them will result in horrible visuals suitable only for avant-garde "
"experimental indie games."
msgstr ""
"請記住, **sRGB ->顯示線性(Display Linear)** 和 **顯示線性 -> sRGB** 的轉換必"
