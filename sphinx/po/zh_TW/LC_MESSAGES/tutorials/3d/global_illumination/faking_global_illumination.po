msgid "Why fake global illumination?"
msgstr "怎麼樣算是好的說明文件？"

msgid ""
"Godot provides several global illumination (GI) techniques, all with their "
"advantages and drawbacks. Nonetheless, it remains possible to avoid using "
"any GI technique and use a handmade approach instead. There are a few "
"reasons for using a \"handmade\" approach to global illumination instead of "
"VoxelGI, SDFGI or baked lightmaps:"
msgstr ""
"Godot 提供了多種全域照明 (GI) 技術，各有其優點和缺點。儘管如此，仍然可以避免"
"使用任何地理旗標技術並使用手工製作方法。使用「手工」方法進行全域照明而不是 "
"VoxelGI、SDFGI 或烘焙光照貼圖有幾個原因："

msgid ""
"You need to have good rendering performance, but can't afford going through "
"a potentially cumbersome lightmap baking process."
msgstr "您需要具有良好的算繪性能，但無法承受潛在繁瑣的光照貼圖烘焙過程。"

msgid ""
"You need an approach to GI that is fully real-time *and* works in "
"procedurally generated levels."
msgstr "您需要一種完全即時*且*可在程式產生的關卡中運作的 GI 方法。"

msgid ""
"You need an approach to GI that is fully real-time *and* does not suffer "
"from significant light leaks."
msgstr "您需要一種完全即時的 GI 方法*並且*不會出現明顯的漏光問題。"

msgid ""
"The approaches described below only cover indirect diffuse lighting, not "
"specular lighting. For specular lighting, consider using ReflectionProbes "
"which are usually cheap enough to be used in conjunction with this fake GI "
"approach."
msgstr ""
"以下所述的方法僅涵蓋間接漫射照明，而不涵蓋鏡面照明。對於鏡面照明，請考慮使用 "
"ReflectionProbes，它通常足夠便宜，可以與這種假 GI 方法結合使用。"

msgid ""
"Not sure if faking global illumination with lights is suited to your needs? "
"See :ref:`doc_introduction_to_global_illumination_comparison` for a "
"comparison of GI techniques available in Godot 4."
msgstr ""
"不確定用燈光偽造全域照明是否適合您的需求？請參閱 "
"doc_introduction_to_global_Illumination_comparison` 以了解 Godot 4 中可用的 "
"GI 技術的比較。"

msgid "Faking DirectionalLight3D global illumination"
msgstr "偽造 DirectionalLight3D 的全域光照"

msgid ""
"While the sky provides its own directional lighting, the scene's main "
"DirectionalLight3D node typically emits a large amount of light. When using "
"a GI technique, this light would be reflected on solid surfaces and would "
"bounce back on most outdoors shaded surfaces."
msgstr ""
"雖然天空提供自己的定向照明，但場景的主要 DirectionalLight3D 節點通常會發出大"
"量的光。當使用 GI 技術時，這種光會在固體表面上反射，並會在大多數戶外陰影表面"
"上反射回來。"

msgid ""
"We can fake this by adding a second DirectionalLight3D node with the "
"following changes:"
msgstr "我們也可以通過在第一個向量的末尾加上第二個向量來直觀地看到這一點:"

msgid ""
"Rotate the light by 180 degrees. This allows it to represent lighting "
"bounced by the main DirectionalLight3D node."
msgstr ""
"將燈光旋轉 180 度。這使得它能夠表示由主 DirectionalLight3D 節點反射的光照。"

msgid ""
"Set **Shadows** to **Off**. This reduces the secondary light's performance "
"burden while also allowing shaded areas to receive *some* lighting (which is "
"what we want here)."
msgstr ""
"將 **陰影** 設定為 **關閉**。這減少了輔助光的性能負擔，同時還允許陰影區域接"
"收“一些”照明（這就是我們在這裡想要的）。"

msgid ""
"Set **Energy** to 10-40% of the original value. There is no \"perfect\" "
"value, so experiment with various energy values depending on the light and "
"your typical material colors."
msgstr ""
"將**能量**設定為原始值的 10-40%。不存在“完美”值，因此請根據光線和典型材質顏色"
"嘗試各種能量值。"

msgid ""
"Set **Specular** to ``0.0``. Indirect lighting shouldn't emit visible "
"specular lobes, so we need to disable specular lighting entirely for the "
"secondary light."
msgstr ""
"將 **鏡面** 設定為“0.0”。間接照明不應發出可見的鏡面光波瓣，因此我們需要完全停"
"用輔助光的鏡面照明。"

msgid ""
"This approach works best in scenes that are mostly outdoors. When going "
"indoors, the secondary DirectionalLight3D's light will still be visible as "
"this light has shadows disabled."
msgstr ""
"這種方法最適合大多數戶外場景。當進入室內時，輔助 DirectionalLight3D 的燈光仍"
"然可見，因為該燈光禁用了陰影。"

msgid ""
"This can be worked around by smoothly decreasing the secondary "
"DirectionalLight3D's energy when entering an indoor area (and doing the "
"opposite when leaving the indoor area). For instance, this can be achieved "
"using an Area3D node and AnimationPlayer."
msgstr ""
"這可以透過在進入室內區域時平滑地減少輔助 DirectionalLight3D 的能量（並在離開"
"室內區域時執行相反的操作）來解決。例如，這可以使用 Area3D 節點和 "
"AnimationPlayer 來實作。"

msgid "Faking positional light global illumination"
msgstr "偽造位置燈光的全域光照"

msgid ""
"It's possible to follow the same approach as DirectionalLight3D for "
"positional lights (OmniLight3D and SpotLight3D). However, this will require "
"more manual work as this operation needs to be repeated for every positional "
"light node in the scene to look good."
msgstr ""
"對於位置光源（OmniLight3D 和 SpotLight3D），可以採用與 DirectionalLight3D 相"
"同的方法。然而，這將需要更多的手動工作，因為需要對場景中的每個位置光節點重複"
"此操作才能看起來不錯。"

msgid ""
"In an ideal scenario, additional OmniLight3Ds should be added at every "
"location where a significant amount of light hits a bright enough surface. "
"However, due to time constraints, this isn't always easily feasible "
"(especially when performing procedural level generation)."
msgstr ""
"在理想情況下，應在大量光線照射到足夠明亮表面的每個位置新增額外的 "
"OmniLight3D。然而，由於時間限制，這並不總是容易實作（特別是在執行程式關卡產生"
"時）。"

msgid ""
"If you're in a hurry, you can place a secondary OmniLight3D node at the same "
"position as the main OmniLight3D node. You can add this node as a child of "
"the main OmniLight3D node to make it easy to move and hide both nodes at the "
"same time."
msgstr ""
"如果您趕時間，可以將輔助 OmniLight3D 節點放置在與主 OmniLight3D 節點相同的位"
"置。您可以將此節點新增為主 OmniLight3D 節點的子節點，以便輕鬆同時移動並隱藏這"
"兩個節點。"

msgid "In the secondary OmniLight3D node, perform the following changes:"
msgstr "在輔助 OmniLight3D 節點中，執行下列變更："

msgid ""
"Increase the light's **Range** by 25-50%. This allows the secondary light to "
"lighten what was previously not lit by the original light."
msgstr ""
"將燈光的**範圍**增加 25-50%。這使得輔助光能夠照亮先前未被原始光照亮的區域。"

msgid ""
"Set **Energy** to 10-40% of the original value. There is no \"perfect\" "
"value, so experiment with various energy values depending on the light and "
"its surroundings."
msgstr ""
"將**能量**設定為原始值的 10-40%。不存在“完美”值，因此請根據光線及其周圍環境嘗"
"試各種能量值。"

msgid ""
"Set **Specular** to 0. Indirect lighting shouldn't emit visible specular "
"lobes, so we need to disable specular lighting entirely for the secondary "
"light."
msgstr ""
"將 **Specular** 設為 0。間接照明不應發出可見的鏡面反射波瓣，因此我們需要完全"
"停用輔助光的鏡面反射照明。"

msgid ""
"For SpotLight3D, the same trick can be used. In this case, the secondary "
"OmniLight3D should be placed in a way that reflects where *most* light will "
"be bounced. This is usually close to the SpotLight3D's primary impact "
"location."
msgstr ""
"對於 SpotLight3D，可以使用相同的技巧。在這種情況下，輔助 OmniLight3D 的放置方"
"式應能反射「大多數」光線將被反射的位置。這通常靠近 SpotLight3D 的主要影響位"
"置。"

msgid ""
"In the example below, a SpotLight3D node is used to light up the room's "
"floor. However, since there is no indirect lighting, the rest of the room "
"remains entirely dark. In real life, the room's walls and ceiling would be "
"lit up by light bouncing around. Using an OmniLight3D node positioned "
"between the SpotLight3D's origin and the floor allows simulating this effect:"
msgstr ""
"在下面的範例中，SpotLight3D 節點用於照亮房間的地板。然而，由於沒有間接照明，"
"房間的其餘部分仍然完全黑暗。在現實生活中，房間的牆壁和天花板會被周圍反射的光"
"線照亮。使用位於 SpotLight3D 的原點和地板之間的 OmniLight3D 節點可以模擬此效"
"果："
