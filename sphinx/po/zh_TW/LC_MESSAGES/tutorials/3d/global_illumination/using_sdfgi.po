"Signed distance field global illumination (SDFGI) is a novel technique "
"available in Godot 4.0. It provides semi-real-time global illumination that "
"scales to any world size and works with procedurally generated levels."
msgstr ""
"有符號距離場全域照明 (SDFGI) 是 Godot 4.0 中提供的新技術。它提供半實時全域照"
"明，可縮放至任何世界尺寸並適用於程式生成的等級。"

msgid ""
"SDFGI supports dynamic lights, but *not* dynamic occluders or dynamic "
"emissive surfaces. Therefore, SDFGI provides better real-time ability than :"
"ref:`baked lightmaps <doc_using_lightmap_gi>`, but worse real-time ability "
"than :ref:`VoxelGI <doc_using_voxel_gi>`."
msgstr ""
"SDFGI 支援動態燈光，但*不*動態遮擋器或動態發射表面。因此，SDFGI 提供了比烘焙"
"光照貼圖更好的即時能力，但比 VoxelGI 差。"

msgid ""
"From a performance standpoint, SDFGI is one of the most demanding global "
"illumination techniques in Godot. Like with VoxelGI, there are still many "
"settings available to tweak its performance requirements at the cost of "
"quality."
msgstr ""
"從效能角度來看，SDFGI 是 Godot 中要求最高的全域照明技術之一。與 VoxelGI 一"

msgid ""
"SDFGI is only supported when using the Forward Plus rendering backend, not "
"the Forward Mobile or Compatibility backends."

msgid ""
"In the Environment resource, there are several properties available to "
"adjust SDFGI appearance and quality:"
msgstr "在環境資源中，有幾個屬性可用於調整 SDFGI 外觀和品質："

msgid ""
"**Use Occlusion:** If enabled, SDFGI will throw additional rays to find and "
"reduce light leaks. This has a performance cost, so only enable this "
"property if you actually need it."
msgstr ""
"**使用遮蔽：** 如果啟用，SDFGI 將投射額外的光線來發現並減少漏光。這會產生效能"
"成本，因此僅在您確實需要時才啟用此屬性。"

msgid ""
"**Read Sky Light:** If enabled, the environment lighting is represented in "
"the global illumination. This should be enabled in outdoor scenes and "
"disabled in fully indoor scenes."
msgstr ""
"**讀取天空光：** 如果啟用，環境照明將在全域照明中表示。應在室外場景中啟用此功"
"能，並在完全室內場景中停用此功能。"

msgid ""
"**Bounce Feedback:** By default, indirect lighting only bounces once when "
"using SDFGI. Setting this value above ``0.0`` will cause SDFGI to bounce "
"more than once, which provides more realistic indirect lighting at a small "
"performance cost. Sensible values are usually between ``0.3`` and ``1.0`` "
"depending on the scene. Note that in some scenes, values above ``0.5`` can "
"cause infinite feedback loops to happen, causing the scene to become "
"extremely bright in a few seconds' time. If your indirect lighting looks "
"\"splotchy\", consider increasing this value above ``0.0`` to get more "
"uniform-looking lighting. If your lighting ends up looking too bright as a "
"result, decrease **Energy** to compensate."
msgstr ""
"**反彈回饋：** 預設情況下，使用 SDFGI 時間接照明僅反彈一次。將此值設為高"
"於“0.0”將導致 SDFGI 多次反彈，從而以較小的性能成本提供更真實的間接照明。根據"
"場景，敏感值通常在「0.3」和「1.0」之間。請注意，在某些場景中，高於「0.5」的值"
"可能會導致無限回饋循環發生，導致場景在幾秒鐘內變得極其明亮。如果您的間接照明"
"看起來“有斑點”，請考慮將該值增加到“0.0”以上，以獲得更均勻的照明。如果您的照明"
"最終看起來太亮，請減少**能量**進行補償。"

msgid ""
"**Cascades:** Higher values result in more detailed GI information (and/or "
"greater maximum distance), but are significantly more expensive on the CPU "
"and GPU. The performance cost of having more cascades especially increases "
"when the camera moves fast, so consider decreasing this to ``4`` or lower if "
"your camera moves fast."
msgstr ""
"**級聯：**較高的值會產生更詳細的 GI 資訊（和/或更大的最大距離），但在 CPU 和 "
"GPU 上的成本明顯更高。當相機快速移動時，擁有更多級聯的性能成本尤其會增加，因"
"此如果您的相機移動快速，請考慮將其減少到“4”或更低。"

msgid ""
"**Min Cell Size:** The minimum SDFGI cell size to use for the nearest, most "
"detailed cascade. Lower values result in more accurate indirect lighting and "
"reflection at the cost of lower performance. Adjusting this setting also "
"affects **Cascade 0 Distance** and **Max Distance** automatically."
msgstr ""
"**最小單元尺寸：** 用於最近、最詳細級聯的最小 SDFGI 單元尺寸。較低的值會導致"
"更準確的間接照明和反射，但代價是性能較低。調整此設定也會自動影響 **Cascade 0 "
"Distance** 和 **Max Distance**。"

msgid ""
"**Cascade 0 Distance:** The distance at which the nearest, most detailed "
"cascade ends. Greater values make the nearest cascade transition less "
"noticeable, at the cost of reducing the level of detail in the nearest "
"cascade. Adjusting this setting also affects **Min Cell Size** and **Max "
"Distance** automatically."
msgstr ""
"**級聯 0 距離：** 最近、最詳細的級聯結束的距離。數值越大，最近的級聯過渡越不"
"明顯，但代價是降低最近級聯的細節等級。調整此設定也會自動影響 **最小像元大小"
"** 和 **最大距離**。"

msgid ""
"**Max Distance:** Controls how far away the signed distance field will be "
"computed (for the least detailed cascade). SDFGI will not have any effect "
"past this distance. This value should always be set below the Camera's Far "
"value, as there is no benefit in computing SDFGI past the viewing distance. "
"Adjusting this setting also affects **Min Cell Size** and **Cascade 0 "
"Distance** automatically."
msgstr ""
"**最大距離：** 控制計算有符號距離場的距離（對於最不詳細的級聯）。 SDFGI 超過"
"此距離不會產生任何影響。該值應始終設定為低於相機的遠值，因為計算超過觀看距離"
"的 SDFGI 沒有任何好處。調整此設定也會自動影響 **最小像元大小** 和 **級聯 0 距"
"離**。"

msgid ""
"**Y Scale:** Controls how far apart SDFGI probes are spread *vertically*. By "
"default, vertical spread is the same as horizontal. However, since most game "
"scenes aren't highly vertical, setting the Y Scale to ``75%`` or even "
"``50%`` can provide better quality and reduce light leaks without impacting "
"performance."
msgstr ""
"**Y 比例：** 控制 SDFGI 探查*垂直*分佈的距離。預設情況下，垂直傳播與水平傳播"
"相同。然而，由於大多數遊戲場景不是高度垂直的，因此將 Y 比例設定為「75%」甚至"
"「50%」可以提供更好的品質並減少漏光，而不會影響效能。"

msgid "**Energy:** The brightness multiplier for SDFGI's indirect lighting."
msgstr "**能量：** SDFGI 間接照明的亮度乘數。"

msgid ""
"**Normal Bias:** The normal bias to use for SDFGI's probe ray bounces. "
"Unlike **Probe Bias**, this only increases the value in relation to the "
"mesh's normals. This makes the bias adjustment more nuanced and avoids "
"increasing the bias too much for no reason. Increase this value if you "
"notice striping artifacts in indirect lighting or reflections."
msgstr ""
"**法線偏差：** 用於 SDFGI 偵測射線反彈的法線偏差。與 **探查偏差** 不同，這只"
"會增加相對於網格法線的值。這使得偏差調整更加細緻，避免無緣無故增加偏差太多。"
"如果您發現間接照明或反射中出現條紋偽影，請增加此值。"

msgid ""
"**Probe Bias:** The bias to use for SDFGI's probe ray bounces. Increase this "
"value if you notice striping artifacts in indirect lighting or reflections."

msgid ""
"**Static (default):** The mesh will be taken into account in SDFGI "
"generation. The mesh will both receive *and* contribute indirect lighting to "
"the scene. If the mesh is changed in any way after SDFGI is generated, the "
"camera must move away from the object then move back close to it for SDFGI "
"to regenerate. Alternatively, SDFGI can be toggled off and back on. If "
"neither is done, indirect lighting will look incorrect."
msgstr ""
"**靜態（預設）：** SDFGI 生成中將考慮網格。網格將接收*並*為場景提供間接照明。"
"如果在生成 SDFGI 後網格以任何方式發生更改，則相機必須遠離物件然後移回靠近對"

msgid ""
"**Dynamic (not supported with SDFGI):** The mesh won't be taken into account "

"but it will not contribute indirect lighting to the scene. *This acts "

msgid ""
"**Static:** The light will be taken into account for SDFGI baking. The light "

"will look incorrect. If in doubt, use this mode for level lighting."
msgstr ""
"**靜態：** SDFGI 烘焙時將考慮光線。燈光將為場景提供間接照明。如果烘焙後燈光以"
"任何方式發生變化，間接照明將看起來不正確，直到相機遠離燈光並返回（這會導致 "

msgid ""
"**Dynamic (default):** The light won't be taken into account for SDFGI "

msgstr ""
"**動態（預設）：** SDFGI 烘焙不會考慮燈光，但它仍會即時為場景提供間接照明。"

msgstr ""
"**Sdfgi > 偵測光線計數：** 值越高，品質越好，但代價是 GPU 使用率較高。如果該"

msgid ""
"**Sdfgi > Frames To Converge:** Higher values result in better quality, but "
"GI will take more time to fully converge. The effect of this setting is "
"especially noticeable when first loading a scene, or when lights with a bake "
"mode other than **Disabled** are moving fast. If this value is set too low, "
"this can cause surfaces to have visible \"splotches\" of indirect lighting "
"on them due to the number of rays thrown being very low. If your scene's "

"setting this to ``30`` to improve quality without impacting performance."
msgstr ""
"**Sdfgi > 收斂影格數：** 值越高，品質越好，但 GI 需要更多時間才能完全收斂。當"
"首次加載場景時，或者當具有除**禁用**之外的烘焙模式的燈光快速移動時，此設定的"

"請考慮將其設定為「30」以提高品質而不影響效能。"

msgid ""
"**Sdfgi > Frames To Update Light:** Lower values result in moving lights "

msgid ""
"**Gi > Use Half Resolution:** If enabled, both SDFGI and VoxelGI will have "
"their GI buffer rendering at halved resolution. For instance, when rendering "
"in 3840×2160, the GI buffer will be computed at a 1920×1080 resolution. "

msgid ""
"When SDFGI is enabled, it will also take some time for global illumination "

"transition effect while GI is still converging. To hide this, you can use a "
"ColorRect node that spans the whole viewport and fade it out when switching "

msgstr ""
"當SDFGI啟用時，全域照明完全收斂也需要一些時間（預設25影格）。這可以在 GI 仍在"

"ColorRect 節點，並在使用 AnimationPlayer 節點切換場景時將其淡出。"

msgid ""
"The signed distance field is only updated when the camera moves in and out "
