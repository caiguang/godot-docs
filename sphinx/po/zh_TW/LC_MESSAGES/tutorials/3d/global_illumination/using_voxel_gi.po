msgid ""
"The following properties can be adjusted in the VoxelGI node inspector "
"before baking:"
msgstr "烘焙前，可以在 VoxelGI 節點的屬性面板中調整以下屬性："

msgid ""
"**Subdiv:** Higher values result in more precise indirect lighting, at the "
"cost of lower performance, longer bake times and increased storage "
"requirements."
msgstr ""
"**細分：** 較高的值會導致更精確的間接照明，但代價是性能較低、烘烤時間更長以及"
"儲存需求增加。"

msgid ""
"**Extents:** Represents the size of the box in which indirect lighting "
"should be baked. Extents are centered around the VoxelGI node's origin."
msgstr ""
"**範圍：** 表示應在其中烘焙間接照明的盒子的大小。範圍以 VoxelGI 節點的原點為"
"中心。"

msgid ""
"The following properties can be adjusted in the VoxelGIData *resource* that "
"is contained within a VoxelGI node after it has been baked:"
msgstr ""
"烘焙後，可以在 VoxelGI 節點中包含的 VoxelGIData *資源* 中調整下列屬性："

msgid ""
"**Dynamic Range:** The maximum brightness that can be represented in "
"indirect lighting. Higher values make it possible to represent brighter "
"indirect light, at the cost of lower precision (which can result in visible "
"banding). If in doubt, leave this unchanged."
msgstr ""
"**動態範圍：** 在間接照明中可以表示的最大亮度。較高的值可以表示更亮的間接光，"
"但代價是精度較低（可能導致可見條帶）。如有疑問，請保持不變。"

msgid ""
"**Energy:** The indirect lighting's overall energy. This also effects the "
"energy of direct lighting emitted by meshes with emissive materials."
msgstr ""
"**能量：** 間接照明的整體能量。這也會影響具有發射材料的網格發射的直接照明的能"
"量。"

msgid ""
"**Bias:** Optional bias added to lookups into the voxel buffer at run time. "
"This helps avoid self-occlusion artifacts."
msgstr ""
"**偏差：** 在運作時新增到體素緩衝區搜尋的可選偏差。這有助於避免自遮擋偽影。"

msgid ""
"**Normal Bias:** Similar to **Bias**, but offsets the lookup into the voxel "
"buffer by the surface normal. This also helps avoid self-occlusion "
"artifacts. Higher values reduce self-reflections visible in non-rough "
"materials, at the cost of more visible light leaking and flatter-looking "
"indirect lighting. To prioritize hiding self-reflections over lighting "
"quality, set **Bias** to ``0.0`` and **Normal Bias** to a value between "
"``1.0`` and ``2.0``."
msgstr ""
"**法線偏差：** 與 **偏差** 類似，但透過表面法線偏移對體素緩衝區的搜尋。這也有"
"助於避免自遮擋偽影。較高的值會減少非粗糙材料中可見的自反射，但代價是更多的可"

"**Bias** 設定為“0.0”，將 **Normal Bias** 設定為“1.0”和“2.0”之間的值。"

msgid ""
"**Propagation:** The energy factor to use for bounced indirect lighting. "
"Higher values will result in brighter, more diffuse lighting (which may end "
"up looking too flat). When **Use Two Bounces** is enabled, you may want to "
"decrease **Propagation** to compensate for the overall brighter indirect "
"lighting."
msgstr ""
"**傳播：** 用於反射間接照明的能量因子。較高的值將導致更亮、更漫射的照明（最終"
"可能看起來太平坦）。啟用「使用兩次反射」時，您可能需要減少「傳播」以補償整體"
"更亮的間接照明。"

msgid ""
"**Use Two Bounces:** If enabled, lighting will bounce twice instead of just "
"once. This results in more realistic-looking indirect lighting, and makes "
"indirect lighting visible in reflections as well. Enabling this generally "
"has no noticeable performance cost."
msgstr ""
"**使用兩次反彈：** 如果啟用，燈光將反彈兩次而不是一次。這會產生更真實的間接照"
"明，並使間接照明在反射中也可見。啟用此功能通常不會產生明顯的效能成本。"

msgid ""
"**Interior:** If enabled, environment sky lighting will not be taken into "
"account by VoxelGI. This should be enabled in indoor scenes to avoid light "
"leaking from the environment."
msgstr ""
"**室內：** 如果啟用，VoxelGI 將不會考慮環境天空照明。應在室內場景中啟用此功"

msgid "There are 3 global illumination modes available for meshes:"
msgstr "有四種可用於取得設定的巨集："

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** The mesh won't be taken into account for VoxelGI baking. The "

msgstr ""
"**Enabled（啟用）** ：啟用探查捕獲，使得動態物件能夠 *接受* 間接光照。無論此"
"選項是否啟用，動態物件都無法對場景 *造成* 間接光照，這是光照貼圖的局限性。"

msgid ""
"**Static (default):** The mesh will be taken into account for VoxelGI "
"baking. The mesh will both receive *and* contribute indirect lighting to the "
"scene. If the mesh is changed in any way after baking, the VoxelGI node must "
"be baked again. Otherwise, indirect lighting will look incorrect."
msgstr ""
"**靜態（預設）：** VoxelGI 烘焙時將考慮網格。網格將接收*並*為場景提供間接照"

"起來會不正確。"

msgid ""
"**Dynamic:** The mesh won't be taken into account for VoxelGI baking, but it "
"will still receive *and* contribute indirect lighting to the scene in real-"
"time. This option is much slower compared to **Static**. Only use the "
"**Dynamic** global illumination mode on large meshes that will change "
"significantly during gameplay."
msgstr ""
"**動態：** VoxelGI 烘焙時不會考慮網格，但它仍會即時接收*並*為場景貢獻間接光"

msgid ""
"**Static:** The light will be taken into account for VoxelGI baking. The "

"indirect lighting will look incorrect. If in doubt, use this mode for level "
"lighting."
msgstr ""
"**靜態：** VoxelGI 烘焙時將考慮光線。燈光將為場景提供間接照明。如果烘焙後光照"
"發生任何變化，則必須再次烘焙 VoxelGI 節點，否則間接光照將看起來不正確。如果有"
"疑問，請使用此模式進行水平照明。"

msgid ""
"**Dynamic (default):** The light won't be taken into account for VoxelGI "
"baking, but it will still contribute indirect lighting to the scene in real-"

"global illumination mode on lights that will change significantly during "
"gameplay."
msgstr ""
"**動態（預設）：** VoxelGI 烘焙不會考慮燈光，但它仍會即時為場景提供間接照明。"
"與 **靜態** 相比，此選項速度較慢。僅對遊戲過程中會發生顯著變化的燈光使用**動"

msgid ""
"The amount of indirect energy emitted by a light depends on its color, "

"光發出的間接能量的量取決於其顏色、能量*和*間接能量屬性。要使特定燈光發出或多"

msgid "Adjusting VoxelGI performance and quality"
msgstr "調整 VoxelGI 的性能與品質"

msgid ""
"Since VoxelGI is relatively demanding, it will perform best on systems with "
"recent dedicated GPUs. On older dedicated GPUs and integrated graphics, "
"tweaking the settings is necessary to achieve reasonable performance."
msgstr ""
"由於 VoxelGI 的要求相對較高，因此它在配備最新專用 GPU 的系統上表現最佳。在較"

"VoxelGI quality can also be adjusted in two ways:"
msgstr ""
"在專案設定的**算繪 > 全域照明**部分中，VoxelGI 品質也可以透過兩種方式調整："

msgid ""
"**Voxel Gi > Quality:** If set to **Low** instead of **High**, voxel cone "

"cost of less pronounced ambient occlusion."
msgstr ""
"**體素Gi > 品質：** 如果設定為**低** 而不是**高**，體素錐追蹤將只使用4 個抽頭"
"而不是6 個。這會加快算繪速度，但代價是環境遮擋不太明顯。"

msgid ""
"**Gi > Use Half Resolution:** If enabled, both VoxelGI and SDFGI will have "
"their GI buffer rendering at halved resolution. For instance, when rendering "
"in 3840×2160, the GI buffer will be computed at a 1920×1080 resolution. "
"Enabling this option saves a lot of GPU time, but it can introduce visible "
"aliasing around thin details."
msgstr ""
"**Gi > 使用一半解析度：** 如果啟用，VoxelGI 和 SDFGI 都將以減半解析度算繪 GI "
"緩衝區。例如，當以 3840×2160 算繪時，GI 緩衝區將以 1920×1080 解析度計算。啟用"
"此選項可以節省大量 GPU 時間，但它可能會在薄細節周圍引入可見的鋸齒。"

msgstr "請注意，必須在專案設定對話方塊中啟用 **進階** 切換才能使上述設定可見。"

msgid ""
"Additionally, VoxelGI can be disabled entirely by hiding the VoxelGI node. "
"This can be used for comparison purposes or to improve performance on low-"

msgstr "對於漏光和偽影，請嘗試移動或旋轉 VoxelGI 節點，然後再次烘焙。"

msgid ""
"To combat light leaking in general, ensure your level geometry is fully "

msgstr ""
"為了防止漏光，請確保關卡幾何體完全密封。這最好在用於設計關卡的 3D 建模軟體中"

"Bake VoxelGI again, then hide the primitive MeshInstance3D node (it will "

msgid ""
"If you notice VoxelGI nodes popping in and out of existence as the camera "
