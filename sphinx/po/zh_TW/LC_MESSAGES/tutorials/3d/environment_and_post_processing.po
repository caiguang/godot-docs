msgid ""
"Godot 4 provides a redesigned Environment resource, as well as a new post-"
"processing system with many available effects right out of the box."
msgstr ""
"Godot 3提供了重新設計的環境資源(Environment resource), 以及一個全新的後期處理"
"(post-processing)系統, 其開箱即用, 具有許多可用的效果."

msgid ""
"As of Godot 4, Environment *performance/quality* settings are defined in the "
"project settings instead of in the Environment resource. This makes global "
"adjustments easier, as you no longer have to tweak Environment resources "
"individually to suit various hardware configurations."
msgstr ""
"從 Godot 4 開始，環境*效能/品質*設定是在專案設定中定義的，而不是在環境資源中"
"定義的。這使得全域調整變得更加容易，因為您不再需要單獨調整環境資源來適應各種"
"硬體配置。"

msgid ""
"Note that most Environment performance/quality settings are only visible "
"after enabling the **Advanced** toggle in the Project Settings."
msgstr ""
"請注意，大多數環境效能/品質設定僅在專案設定中啟用**進階**開關後才可見。"

msgid "Environment"
msgstr "環境"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`class_Environment` resource stores all the information required "
"for controlling the 2D and 3D rendering environment. This includes the sky, "
"ambient lighting, tone mapping, effects, and adjustments. By itself, it does "
"nothing, but you can enable it by using it in one of the following "
"locations, in order of priority:"
msgstr ""
"Environment資源儲存控制算繪環境所需的所有資訊. 這包括天空, 環境照明, 色調對"
"應, 效果和調整. 它本身什麼都不做, 但是一旦在以下位置之一中按優先順序順序使用"
"它就會啟用:"

msgid "Camera3D node (high priority)"
msgstr "陣列索引（最高優先度）"

msgid ""
"An Environment can be set to a Camera3D node. It will have priority over any "
"other setting."
msgstr "可以為 Camera3D 節點設定 Environment。優先於其他所有設定。"

msgid ""
"This is mostly useful when you want to override an existing environment, but "
"in general it's a better idea to use the option below."
msgstr "這在想要覆蓋現有環境時非常有用, 但通常使用下面的選項更好."

msgid "WorldEnvironment node (medium priority, recommended)"
msgstr "WorldEnvironment 節點（中優先順序，推薦）"

msgid ""
"The WorldEnvironment node can be added to any scene, but only one can exist "
"per active scene tree. Adding more than one will result in a warning."
msgstr ""
"WorldEnvironment節點可以新增到任何場景, 但每個活動場景樹只能存在一個. 新增多"
"個將導致警告."

msgid ""
"Any Environment added has higher priority than the default Environment "
"(explained below). This means it can be overridden on a per-scene basis, "
"which makes it quite useful."
msgstr ""
"新增的任何 Environment 都具有比預設 Environment 更高的優先順序（後述）。這意"
"味著它可以針對各個場景分別進行覆蓋，這使它非常有用。"

msgid "Preview environment and sun (low priority)"
msgstr "賦值（最低優先度）"

msgid ""
"Since Godot 4, the preview environment and sun system replace the "
"``default_env.tres`` file that was used in Godot 3 projects."
msgstr ""
"從 Godot 4 開始，預覽環境和太陽的系統替代了 Godot 3 專案中使用的 "
"``default_env.tres`` 檔案。"

msgid ""
"If no WorldEnvironment node or DirectionalLight3D node is present in the "
"current scene, the editor will display a preview environment and sun "
"instead. This can be disabled using the buttons at the top of the 3D editor:"
msgstr ""
"如果目前場景中不存在 WorldEnvironment 節點或 DirectionalLight3D 節點，編輯器"
"會改為顯示預覽環境和太陽。可以使用 3D 編輯器頂部的按鈕禁用："

msgid ""
"Clicking on the 3 vertical dots on the right will display a dialog which "
"allows you to customize the appearance of the preview environment:"
msgstr ""
"點擊右側的垂直排列的三個點就會顯示一個對話方塊，能夠用來自定義預覽環境的外"
"觀："

msgid ""
"**The preview sun and sky is only visible in the editor, not in the running "
"project.** Using the buttons at the bottom of the dialog, you can add the "
"preview sun and sky into the scene as nodes."
msgstr ""
"**預覽太陽和天空只在編輯器中可見，運作專案時不可見。**使用對話方塊底部的按鈕"
"就可以將預覽太陽和天空作為節點加入到場景中。"

msgid ""
"If you hold :kbd:`Shift` while clicking **Add Sun to Scene** or **Add "
"Environment to Scene** in the preview environment editor, this will add both "
"a preview sun and environment to the current scene (as if you clicked both "
"buttons separately). Use this to speed up project setup and prototyping."
msgstr ""
"在預覽環境編輯器中，點擊**將太陽新增到場景**或**將環境新增到場景**時按住 :"
"kbd:`Shift`，就會將預覽太陽和預覽環境一同新增到目前場景中（就像單獨點擊了這兩"
"個按鈕一樣）。可以使用這個方法加速專案的設定和原型。"

msgid "Camera attributes"
msgstr "相機屬性"

msgid ""
"In Godot 4, exposure and depth of field information was split from the "
"Environment resource into a separate CameraAttributes resource. This allows "
"adjusting those properties independently of other Environment settings more "
"easily."
msgstr ""
"在 Godot 4 中，曝光和景深資訊從環境資源中分離到單獨的 CameraAttributes 資源"
"中。這樣可以更輕鬆地獨立於其他環境設定來調整這些屬性。"

msgid ""
"The :ref:`class_CameraAttributes` resource stores exposure and depth of "
"field information. It also allows enabling automatic exposure adjustments "
"depending on scene brightness."
msgstr ""
"class_CameraAttributes 資源儲存曝光和景深資訊。它還允許根據場景亮度自動調整曝"
"光。"

msgid "There are two kinds of CameraAttribute resources available:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**CameraAttributesPractical:** Features are exposed using arbitrary units, "
"which are easier to reason about for most game use cases."
msgstr ""
"**相機屬性實用：** 使用任意單位公開功能，這對於大多數遊戲用例來說更容易推理。"

msgid ""
"**CameraAttributesPhysical:** Features are exposed using real world units, "
"similar to a digital camera. For example, field of view is set using a focal "
"length in millimeters instead of a value in degrees. Recommended when "
"physical accuracy is important, such as for photorealistic rendering."
msgstr ""
"**相機屬性物理：** 使用現實世界單位曝光特徵，類似數位相機。例如，視野是使用以"
"毫米為單位的焦距而不是以度為單位的值來設定的。當物理精確度很重要時建議使用，"
"例如照片級真實感算繪。"

msgid ""
"Both CameraAttribute resource types allow you to use the same features, but "
"they are configured differently. If you don't know which one to choose, use "
"**CameraAttributesPractical**."
msgstr ""
"兩種 CameraAttribute 資源型別都允許您使用相同的功能，但它們的配置不同。如果您"
"不知道該選擇哪一個，請使用 **CameraAttributesPractical**。"

msgid ""
"Using a :ref:`class_CameraAttributesPhysical` on a Camera3D node will lock "
"out FOV and aspect adjustments in that Camera3D, as field of view is "
"adjusted in the CameraAttributesPhysical resource instead. If used in a "
"WorldEnvironment, the CameraAttributesPhysical will not override any "
"Camera3D in the scene."
msgstr ""
"在 Camera3D 節點上使用 class_CameraAttributesPhysical 將鎖定該 Camera3D 中的 "
"FOV 和方面調整，因為視野是在 CameraAttributesPhysical 資源中調整的。如果在 "
"WorldEnvironment 中使用，CameraAttributesPhysical 將不會覆蓋場景中的任何 "
"Camera3D。"

msgid ""
"A CameraAttributes resource can be added to a Camera3D or a WorldEnvironment "
"node. When the current camera has a CameraAttributes set, it will *override* "
"the one set in WorldEnvironment (if any)."
msgstr ""
"CameraAttributes 資源可以加入到 Camera3D 或 WorldEnvironment 節點。當目前相機"
"設定了 CameraAttributes 時，它將「覆蓋」 WorldEnvironment 中設定的"
"CameraAttributes（如果有）。"

msgid ""
"In most situations, setting the CameraAttributes resource on the Camera3D "
"node instead of the WorldEnvironment is recommended. Unlike "
"WorldEnvironment, assigning the CameraAttributes resource to the Camera3D "
"node prevents depth of field from displaying in the 3D editor viewport, "
"unless the camera is being previewed."
msgstr ""
"在大多數情況下，建議在 Camera3D 節點而不是 WorldEnvironment 上設定 "
"CameraAttributes 資源。與 WorldEnvironment 不同，將 CameraAttributes 資源指派"
"給 Camera3D 節點會阻止景深顯示在 3D 編輯器視窗中，除非正在預覽相機。"

msgid "Environment options"
msgstr "環境可選項"

msgid ""
"The following is a detailed description of all environment options and how "
"they are intended to be used."
msgstr "以下是所有環境選項的詳細說明以及如何使用它們."

msgid "Background"
msgstr "背景"

msgid ""
"The Background section contains settings on how to fill the background "
"(parts of the screen where objects were not drawn). The background not only "
"serves the purpose of displaying an image or color. By default, it also "
"affects how objects are affected by ambient and reflected light. This is "
"called image-based lighting (IBL)."
msgstr ""
"背景(Background) 部分包含有關如何填充背景的設定(螢幕中未繪製物件的部分). 在"
"Godot 3.0中, 背景不僅用於顯示圖像或顏色, 還可以改變物體受環境光和反射光影響的"
"方式."

msgid ""
"As a result, the background sky may greatly impact your scene's overall "
"appearance, even if the sky is never directly visible on screen. This should "
"be taken into account when tweaking lighting in your scene."
msgstr ""
"因此，背景天空可能會極大地影響場景的整體外觀，即使天空在螢幕上永遠不會直接可"
"見。調整場景中的光照時應考慮這一點。"

msgid "There are several background modes available:"
msgstr "有四種可用於取得設定的巨集："

msgid ""
"**Clear Color** uses the default clear color defined in the project "
"settings. The background will be a constant color."
msgstr ""
"** 清晰顏色(Clear Color )** 使用專案設定中定義的預設清晰顏色. 背景將是恒定的"
"顏色."

msgid "**Custom Color** is like Clear Color, but with a custom color value."
msgstr ""
"**自訂顏色(Custom Color)** 與清晰顏色(Clear Color)類似, 但具有自訂顏色值."

msgid ""
"**Sky** lets you define a background sky material (see below). By default, "
"objects in the scene will reflect this sky material and absorb ambient light "
"from it."
msgstr ""
"**天空(Sky)** 可讓您定義全景天空（360 度球體紋理）或程式式天空（具有漸變和可"
"選太陽的簡單天空）。物體將反射它並從中吸收環境光。"

msgid ""
"**Canvas** displays the 2D scene as a background to the 3D scene. This can "
"be used to make environment effects visible on 2D rendering, such as :ref:"
"`glow in 2D <doc_environment_and_post_processing_using_glow_in_2d>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Keep** does not draw any sky, keeping what was present on previous frames "
"instead. This improves performance in purely indoor scenes, but creates a "
"\"hall of mirrors\" visual glitch if the sky is visible at any time."
msgstr ""
"**保留**不會繪製任何天空，而是保留前一影格中存在的內容。這提高了純室內場景中"
"的性能，但如果天空隨時可見，則會產生“鏡廳”視覺故障。"

msgid "Sky materials"
msgstr "材質"

msgid ""
"When using the **Sky** background mode (or the ambient/reflected light mode "
"is set to **Sky**), a Sky subresource becomes available to edit in the "
"Environment resource. Editing this subresource allows you to create a "
"SkyMaterial resource within the Sky."
msgstr ""
"使用 **Sky** 背景模式（或環境光/反射光模式設定為 **Sky**）時，Sky 子資源可在"
"環境資源中進行編輯。編輯此子資源可讓您在 Sky 中建立 SkyMaterial 資源。"

msgid "There are 3 built-in sky materials to choose from:"
msgstr "有 3 種內建天空材質可供選擇："

msgid ""
"**PanoramaSkyMaterial:** Use a 360 degree panorama sky image (2:1 aspect "
"ratio recommended). To benefit from high dynamic range, the panorama image "
"must be in an HDR-compatible format such as ``.hdr`` or ``.exr`` rather than "
"a standard dynamic range format like ``.png`` or ``.jpg``."
msgstr ""
"**PanoramaSkyMaterial：** 使用 360 度全景天空影像（建議長寬比為 2:1）。為了受"
"益於高動態範圍，全景影像必須採用 HDR 相容格式，例如“.hdr”或“.exr”，而不是標準"
"動態範圍格式，例如“.png”或“ .jpg``。"

msgid ""
"**ProceduralSkyMaterial:** Use a procedurally generated sky with adjustable "
"ground, sun, sky and horizon colors. This is the type of sky used in the "
"editor preview. The sun's position is automatically derived from the first 4 "
"DirectionalLight3D nodes present in the scene. There can be up to 4 suns at "
"a given time."
msgstr ""
"**ProceduralSkyMaterial：** 使用程式產生的天空，並可調整地面、太陽、天空和地"
"平線的顏色。這是編輯器預覽中使用的天空型別。太陽的位置是從場景中存在的前 4 "
"個 DirectionalLight3D 節點自動得出的。給定時間最多可以有 4 個太陽。"

msgid ""
"**PhysicalSkyMaterial:** Use a physically-based procedural sky with "
"adjustable scattering parameters. The sun's position is automatically "
"derived from the first DirectionalLight3D node present in the scene. "
"PhysicalSkyMaterial is slightly more expensive to render compared to "
"ProceduralSkyMaterial. There can be up to 1 sun at a given time."
msgstr ""
"**PhysicalSkyMaterial：** 使用具有可調整散射參數的基於物理的程式天空。太陽的"
"位置會自動從場景中存在的第一個 DirectionalLight3D 節點匯出。與 "
"ProceduralSkyMaterial 相比，PhysicalSkyMaterial 的算繪成本稍高。給定時間最多"
"可以有 1 個太陽。"

msgid ""
"Panorama sky images are sometimes called HDRIs (High Dynamic Range Images). "
"You can find freely licensed HDRIs on `Poly Haven <https://polyhaven.com/"
"hdris>`__."
msgstr ""
"全景天空影像有時稱為 HDRI（高動態範圍影像）。您可以在「Poly Haven <https://"
"polyhaven.com/hdris>」上找到免費授權的 HDRI。"

msgid ""
"HDR PanoramaSkyMaterial textures with very bright spots (such as real life "
"photos with the sun visible) may result in visible sparkles on ambient and "
"specular reflections. This is caused by the texture's peak exposure being "
"too high."
msgstr ""
"具有非常亮點的 HDR PanoramaSkyMaterial 紋理（例如可見太陽的現實生活照片）可能"
"會導致環境反射和鏡面反射出現可見的閃光。這是由於紋理的峰值曝光過高所造成的。"

msgid ""
"To resolve this, select the panorama texture in the FileSystem dock, go to "
"the Import dock, enable **HDR Clamp Exposure** then click **Reimport**."
msgstr ""
"若要解決此問題，請在檔案系統塢站中選擇全景紋理，前往匯入塢站，啟用 **HDR 箝位"
"曝光**，然後按一下 **重新匯入**。"

msgid ""
"If you need a custom sky material (e.g. for procedural clouds), you can "
"create a custom :ref:`sky shader <doc_sky_shader>`."
msgstr ""
"如果您需要自訂天空材質（例如程式雲），您可以建立自訂天空著色器 "
"<doc_sky_shader>`。"

msgid "Ambient light"
msgstr "環境光"

msgid ""
"Ambient light (as defined here) is a type of light that affects every piece "
"of geometry with the same intensity. It is global and independent of lights "
"that might be added to the scene. Ambient light is one of the two components "
"of image-based lighting. Unlike reflected light, ambient light does not vary "
"depending on the camera's position and viewing angle."
msgstr ""
"環境(如此處定義)是一種光, 它影響具有相同強度的每個幾何體. 它是全域的, 獨立於"
"可能新增到場景中的燈光."

msgid "There are several types of ambient light to choose from:"
msgstr "這有幾個原因："

msgid ""
"**Background:** Source ambient light from the background, such as the sky, "
"custom color or clear color (default). Ambient light intensity will vary "
"depending on the sky image's contents, which can result in more visually "
"appealing ambient lighting. A sky must be set as background for this mode to "
"be visible."
msgstr ""
"**背景：** 從背景取得環境光，例如天空、自訂顏色或透明顏色（預設）。環境光強度"
"將根據天空影像的內容而變化，這可以產生更具視覺吸引力的環境照明。必須將天空設"
"定為背景才能使此模式可見。"

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** Do not use any ambient light. Useful for purely indoor scenes."
msgstr "**停用：** 不使用任何環境光。對於純室內場景很有用。"

msgid ""
"**Color:** Use a constant color for ambient light, ignoring the background "
"sky. Ambient light intensity will be the same on all sides, which may result "
"in the scene's lighting looking more flat. Useful for indoor scenes where "
"pitch black shadows may be too dark, or to maximize performance on low-end "
"devices."
msgstr ""
"**顏色：** 對環境光使用恆定顏色，忽略背景天空。所有側面的環境光強度都相同，這"
"可能會導致場景的照明看起來更平坦。對於漆黑陰影可能太暗的室內場景很有用，或者"
"可以最大限度地提高低端裝置的性能。"

msgid ""
"**Sky:** Source ambient light from a specified sky, even if the background "
"is set to a mode other than **Sky**. If the background mode is already "
"**Sky**, this mode behaves identically to **Background**."
msgstr ""
"**天空：** 從指定的天空獲取環境光，即使背景設定為 **天空** 以外的模式。如果背"
"景模式已經是 **Sky**，則此模式的行為與 **Background** 相同。"

msgid ""
"When the ambient light mode is set to Sky or Background (and background is "
"set to Sky), it's possible to blend between the ambient color and sky using "
"the **Sky Contribution** property. This value is set to ``1.0`` by default, "
"which means that only the ambient sky is used. The ambient color is ignored "
"unless **Sky Contribution** is decreased below ``1.0``."
msgstr ""
"當 *天空(Sky)* 設定為背景時, 可以使用 **天空貢獻度(Sky Contribution)** 設定在"
"環境顏色(ambient color)和天空(sky)之間進行混合(為方便起見, 此值預設為1.0, 因"
"此只有天空會影響物件)."

msgid "Here is a comparison of how different ambient light affects a scene:"
msgstr "以下是不同環境光對場景的影響比較:"

msgid ""
"Finally, there is an **Energy** setting which is a multiplier. It's useful "
"when working with HDR."
msgstr "最後有一個 **能量(Energy)** 設定, 這是一個乘數, 在使用HDR時非常有用."

msgid ""
"In general, you should only rely on ambient light alone for simple scenes or "
"large exteriors. You may also do so to boost performance. Ambient light is "
"fast to render, but it doesn't provide the best lighting quality. It's "
"better to generate ambient light from :ref:`ReflectionProbe "
"<doc_reflection_probes>`, :ref:`VoxelGI <doc_using_voxel_gi>` or :ref:`SDFGI "
"<doc_using_sdfgi>`, as these will simulate how indirect light propagates "
"more accurately. Below is a comparison, in terms of quality, between using a "
"flat ambient color and a VoxelGI:"
msgstr ""
"一般來說, 環境光應該只用於簡單的場景和大型外景, 或是出於性能考慮(環境光消耗"
"少), 但它不能提供最好的光照品質. 最好是用ReflectionProbe或GIProbe生成環境光, "
"這樣可以更忠實地類比間接光的傳播方式. 下面是使用平面環境色和GIProbe在品質上的"
"比較:"

msgid ""
"Using one of the methods described above will replace constant ambient "
"lighting with ambient lighting from the probes."
msgstr "使用上述方法之一, 物體獲得恒定的環境照明, 由來自探頭的環境光代替."

msgid "Reflected light"
msgstr "反射"

msgid ""
"Reflected light (also called specular light) is the other of the two "
"components of image-based lighting."
msgstr "反射光（也稱為鏡面光）是基於影像的照明的兩個組成部分中的另一個。"

msgid "Reflected light can be set to one of 3 modes:"
msgstr "剛體可以設定為以下四種模式之一："

msgid ""
"**Background:** Reflect from the background, such as the sky, custom color "
"or clear color (default)."
msgstr "**背景：** 從背景反射，例如天空、自訂顏色或透明顏色（預設）。"

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** Do not reflect any light from the environment. Useful for "
"purely indoor scenes, or to maximize performance on low-end devices."
msgstr ""
"**停用：** 不反射環境中的任何光線。適用於純粹的室內場景，或最大限度地提高低階"
"裝置的性能。"

msgid ""
"**Sky:** Reflect from the background sky, even if the background is set to a "
"mode other than **Sky**. If the background mode is already **Sky**, this "
"mode behaves identically to **Background**."
msgstr ""
"**天空：** 從背景天空反射，即使背景設定為 **天空** 以外的模式。如果背景模式已"
"經是 **Sky**，則此模式的行為與 **Background** 相同。"

msgid "Fog"
msgstr "霧"

msgid ""
"This section refers to non-volumetric fog only. It is possible to use both "
"non-volumetric fog and :ref:`doc_volumetric_fog` at the same time."
msgstr "本節僅涉及非體積霧。可以同時使用非體積霧和 doc_volumetric_fog。"

msgid ""
"Fog, as in real life, makes distant objects fade away into a uniform color. "
"There are two kinds of fog in Godot:"
msgstr ""
"霧, 就像在現實生活中一樣, 使遠處的物體逐漸消失成均勻的顏色. 物理效果實際上非"
"常複雜, 但Godot提供了一個很好的近似. Godot有兩種霧:"

msgid ""
"**Depth Fog:** This one is applied based on the distance from the camera."
msgstr "**深度霧:** 這個基於距相機的距離來應用."

msgid ""
"**Height Fog:** This one is applied to any objects below (or above) a "
"certain height, regardless of the distance from the camera."
msgstr ""
"**高度霧:** 此高度應用於任何低於(或高於)某個高度的物體, 無論距離相機的距離如"
"何."

msgid ""
"Both of these fog types can have their curve tweaked, making their "
"transition more or less sharp."
msgstr "這兩種霧型別都可以調整它們的曲線, 使它們的過渡或多或少變得清晰."

msgid "Two properties can be tweaked to make the fog effect more interesting:"
msgstr "可以調整兩個屬性以使霧效果更有趣:"

msgid ""
"The first is **Sun Amount**, which makes use of the Sun Color property of "
"the fog. When looking towards a directional light (usually a sun), the color "
"of the fog will be changed, simulating the sunlight passing through the fog."
msgstr ""
"第一個是 **Sun Amount**，它利用霧的太陽顏色屬性。當朝向平行光（通常是太陽）"
"時，霧的顏色將會改變，模擬穿過霧的陽光。"

msgid ""
"The second is **Transmit Enabled** which simulates more realistic light "
"transmittance. In practice, it makes light stand out more across the fog."
msgstr ""
"第二個是 **Transmit Enabled**，可以模擬更逼真的透射率。實踐中會使光線在霧中更"
"加突出。"

msgid ""
"Fog can cause banding to appear on the viewport, especially at higher "
"density levels. See :ref:`doc_3d_rendering_limitations_color_banding` for "
"guidance on reducing banding."
msgstr ""

msgid "Volumetric Fog"
msgstr "體積霧"

msgid ""
"Volumetric fog provides a realistic fog effect to the scene, with fog color "
"being affected by the lights that traverse the fog."
msgstr "體積霧為場景提供了逼真的霧效果，霧的顏色受到穿過霧的燈光的影響。"

msgid ""
"See :ref:`doc_volumetric_fog` for documentation on setting up volumetric fog."
msgstr "有關設定體積霧的文件，請參閱 doc_volumetric_fog。"

msgid "Tonemap"
msgstr "色調對映"

msgid ""
"Tonemap selects the tonemapping curve that will be applied to the scene, "
"from a list of standard curves used in the film and game industries. "
"Tonemapping operators other than Linear are used to make light and dark "
"areas more homogeneous, while also avoiding clipping of bright highlights."
msgstr ""
"選擇應用於場景的色調對應曲線，選項為電影和遊戲工業中所使用的標準曲線。"

msgid "The tone mapping options are:"
msgstr "而主要缺點如下："

msgid "**Mode:** The tone mapping mode to use."
msgstr "**Mode（模式）：**色調對應所使用的模式。"

msgid ""
"**Linear:** The default tonemapping mode. This is the fastest and simplest "
"tonemapping operator, but it causes bright lighting to look blown out, with "
"noticeable clipping in the output colors."
msgstr ""
"**Linear（線性）：**預設的色調對應模式。這是最快也是最簡單的色調對應運算子，"
"但會導致高亮區域過曝，輸出顏色出現可見的裁剪。"

msgid ""
"**Reinhardt:** Performs a variation on rendered pixels' colors by this "
"formula: ``color = color / (1 + color)``. This avoids clipping bright "
"highlights, but the resulting image can look a bit dull."
msgstr ""
"**Reinhardt：**對算繪後像素的顏色按照這個公式執行變化：``color = color / (1 "
"+ color)``。可以防止裁剪高亮區域，但最終的圖像可能會有些暗淡。"

msgid ""
"**Filmic:** This avoids clipping bright highlights, with a resulting image "
"that usually looks more vivid than Reinhardt."
msgstr "**Filmic：**防止裁剪高亮區域，最終的圖像通常比 Reinhardt 鮮豔。"

msgid ""
"**ACES:** Academy Color Encoding System tonemapper. ACES is slightly more "
"expensive than other options, but it handles bright lighting in a more "
"realistic fashion by desaturating it as it becomes brighter. ACES typically "
"has a more contrasted output compared to Reinhardt and Filmic. ACES is the "
"recommended option when aiming for photorealistic visuals. This tonemapping "
"mode was called \"ACES Fitted\" in Godot 3.x."
msgstr ""
"**ACES Fitted：**Academy Color Encoding System（學院色彩編碼系統）色調對應"

"飽和度越低。ACES 輸出的圖像通常比 Reinhardt 和 Filmic 的對比度更高。想要讓畫"
"面更具真實感時，推薦選用 ACES。"

msgid ""
"**Exposure:** Tone mapping exposure which simulates amount of light received "
"over time (default: ``1.0``). Higher values result in an overall brighter "
"appearance. If the scene appears too dark as a result of a tonemapping "
"operator or whitepoint change, try increasing this value slightly."
msgstr ""
"**Exposure（曝光）：**色調對應曝光，模擬長時間獲取的光照量（預設：``1.0``）。"

"個值略微調高。"

msgid ""
"**White:** Tone mapping whitepoint, which simulates where in the scale white "
"is located (default: ``1.0``). For photorealistic lighting, recommended "
"values are between ``6.0`` and ``8.0``. Higher values result in less blown "
