"``StandardMaterial3D`` and ``ORMMaterial3D`` (Occlusion, Roughness, "
"Metallic) are default 3D materials that aim to provide most of the features "
"artists look for in a material, without the need for writing shader code. "
"However, they can be converted to shader code if additional functionality is "
"needed."
msgstr ""
"``SpatialMaterial`` 是一種預設的3D材質, 旨在提供藝術家在材質中尋找的大部分功"

"碼."

msgid "This tutorial explains the parameters present in both materials."
msgstr "本教學會解釋 ``SpatialMaterial`` 中出現的大多數參數。"

msgid ""
"There are 4 ways to add these materials to an object. A material can be "
"added in the *Material* property of the mesh. It can be added in the "
"*Material* property of the node using the mesh (such as a MeshInstance3D "
"node), the *Material Override* property of the node using the mesh, and the "
"*Material Overlay*."
msgstr ""
"將 ``SpatialMaterial`` 新增到物件有 4 種方法。可以在網格的 *Material*（材質）"

"也可以是 *Material Overlay*（材質覆蓋層）屬性。"

msgid ""
"If you add a material to the mesh itself, every time that mesh is used it "
"will have that material. If you add a material to the node using the mesh, "
"the material will only be used by that node, it will also override the "
"material property of the mesh. If a material is added in the *Material "
"Override* property of the node, it will only be used by that node. It will "
"also override the regular material property of the node and the material "
"property of the mesh."
msgstr ""
"如果你把材質加到網格本身上, 每次那個網格被使用的時候都會有那個材質. 如果你用"
"網格向一個節點新增材質, 那個材質僅會被那個節點使用, 也會覆蓋網格的材質屬性. "
"如果材質被新增到了節點的 *Material Override(材質覆蓋)* 屬性上, 它僅會被那個節"
"點使用, 它也會覆蓋那個節點的常規材質屬性和網格的材質屬性."

msgid ""
"The *Material Overlay* property will render a material **over** the current "

msgid ""
"ORM materials are almost exactly the same with one difference. Instead of "
"separate settings and textures for occlusion, roughness, and metallic, there "
"is a single ORM texture. The different color channels of that texture are "
"used for each parameter. Programs such as Substance Painter and Armor Paint "
"will give you the option to export in this format, for these two programs "
"it's with the export preset for unreal engine, which also uses ORM textures."
msgstr ""
"ORM 材料幾乎完全相同，只有一處不同。沒有單獨的遮蔽、粗糙度和金屬設定和紋理，"

msgid "Transparency"
msgstr "透明"

msgid ""
"By default, materials in Godot are opaque. This is fast to render, but it "
"means the material can't be seen through even if you use a transparent "
"texture in the **Albedo > Texture** property (or set **Albedo > Color** to a "
"transparent color)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To be able to see through a material, the material needs to be made "
"*transparent*. Godot offers several transparency modes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** Material is opaque. This is the fastest to render, with all "
"rendering features supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha:** Material is transparent. Semi-transparent areas are drawn with "
"blending. This is slow to render, but it allows for partial transparency "
"(also known as translucency). Materials using alpha blending also can't cast "
"shadows, and are not visible in screen-space reflections."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Alpha** is a good fit for particle effects and VFX."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Scissor:** Material is transparent. Semi-transparent areas whose "
"opacity is below **Alpha Scissor Threshold** are not drawn (above this "
"opacity, these are drawn as opaque). This is faster to render than Alpha and "
"doesn't exhibit transparency sorting issues. The downside is that this "
"results in \"all or nothing\" transparency, with no intermediate values "
"possible. Materials using alpha scissor can cast shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Scissor** is ideal for foliage and fences, since these have hard "
"edges and require correct sorting to look good."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Hash:** Material is transparent. Semi-transparent areas are drawn "
"using dithering. This is also \"all or nothing\" transparency, but dithering "
"helps represent partially opaque areas with limited precision depending on "
"viewport resolution. Materials using alpha hash can cast shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Hash** is suited for realistic-looking hair, although stylized hair "
"may work better with alpha scissor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Depth Pre-Pass:** This renders the object's fully opaque pixels via the "
"opaque pipeline first, then renders the rest with alpha blending. This "
"allows transparency sorting to be *mostly* correct (albeit not fully so, as "
"partially transparent regions may still exhibit incorrect sorting). "
"Materials using depth prepass can cast shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot will automatically force the material to be transparent with alpha "
"blending if *any* of these conditions is met:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting the transparency mode to **Alpha** (as described here)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting a blend mode other than the default **Mix**"

"<doc_3d_rendering_limitations_transparency_sorting>`:"
msgstr ""
":ref:`透明度排序 <doc_3d_rendering_limitations_transparency_sorting>` 可能會"
"出現問題。"

msgid ""
"Alpha-blended materials are significantly slower to render, especially if "
"they overlap."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alpha-blended materials may exhibit sorting issues when transparent surfaces "
"overlap each other. This means that surfaces may render in the incorrect "
"order, with surfaces in the back appearing to be in front of those which are "
"actually closer to the camera."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alpha-blended materials don't cast shadows, although they can receive "
"shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alpha-blended materials don't appear in any reflections (other than "
"reflection probes)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Screen-space reflections and sharp SDFGI reflections don't appear on alpha-"
"blended materials. When SDFGI is enabled, rough reflections are used as a "
"fallback regardless of material roughness."

msgid "Alpha Antialiasing"
msgstr "抗鋸齒"

msgid ""
"This property is only visible when the transparency mode is **Alpha "
"Scissor** or **Alpha Hash**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While alpha scissor and alpha hash materials are faster to render than alpha-"
"blended materials, they exhibit hard edges between opaque and transparent "
"regions. While it's possible to use post-processing-based :ref:`antialiasing "
"techniques <doc_3d_antialiasing>` such as FXAA and TAA, this is not always "
"desired as these techniques tend to make the final result look blurrier or "
"exhibit ghosting artifacts."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "There are 3 alpha antialiasing modes available:"
msgstr "有四種可用於取得設定的巨集："

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** No alpha antialiasing. Edges of transparent materials will "
"appear aliased unless a post-processing-based antialiasing solution is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Edge Blend:** Results in a smooth transition between opaque and "
"transparent areas. Also known as \"alpha to coverage\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha Edge Clip:** Results in a sharp, but still antialiased transition "
"between opaque and transparent areas. Also known as \"alpha to coverage + "
"alpha to one\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the alpha antialiasing mode is set to **Alpha Edge Blend** or **Alpha "
"Edge Clip**, a new **Alpha Antialiasing Edge** property becomes visible "
"below in the inspector. This property controls the threshold below which "
"pixels should be made transparent. While you've already defined an alpha "
"scissor threshold (when using **Alpha Scissor** only), this additional "
"threshold is used to smoothly transition between opaque and transparent "
"pixels. **Alpha Antialiasing Edge** must *always* be set to a value that is "
"strictly below the alpha scissor threshold. The default of ``0.3`` is a "
"sensible value with an alpha scissor of threshold of ``0.5``, but remember "
"to adjust this alpha antialiasing edge when modifying the alpha scissor "
"threshold."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you find the antialiasing effect not effective enough, try increasing "
"**Alpha Antialiasing Edge** while making sure it's below **Alpha Scissor "
"Threshold** (if the material uses alpha scissor). On the other hand, if you "
"notice the texture's appearance visibly changing as the camera moves closer "
"to the material, try decreasing **Alpha Antialiasing Edge**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For best results, MSAA 3D should be set to at least 2× in the Project "
"Settings when using alpha antialiasing. This is because this feature relies "
"on alpha to coverage, which is a feature provided by MSAA."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without MSAA, a fixed dithering pattern is applied on the material's edges, "
"which isn't very effective at smoothing out edges (although it can still "
"help a little)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Blend Mode"
msgstr "混合模式"

msgid ""
"Controls the blend mode for the material. Keep in mind that any mode other "
"than *Mix* forces the object to go through the transparent pipeline."

"nice for flares or some fire-like effects."
msgstr ""
"**Add：**（新增）對象會進行新增性的混合，非常適合耀斑或類似火焰的效果。"

msgid ""
"**Sub:** The final color of the object is subtracted from the color of the "

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** Used for objects that are double-sided (no culling is "
"performed)."
msgstr "**Disabled:** 用於雙面對象(不進行剔除)."

msgid ""
"By default, Blender has backface culling disabled on materials and will "
"export materials to match how they render in Blender. This means that "
"materials in Godot will have their cull mode set to **Disabled**. This can "
"decrease performance since backfaces will be rendered, even when they are "
"being culled by other faces. To resolve this, enable **Backface Culling** in "
"Blender's Materials tab, then export the scene to glTF again."
msgstr ""
"預設情況下，Blender 在材質上禁用背面剔除，匯出材質時配對其在 Blender 中的算繪"
"方式。這意味著 Godot 中的材質會將其剔除模式設定為 **Disabled**。這會降低性"
"能，因為背面將被算繪，即使它們不可見。要解決此問題，請在 Blender 的材質分頁中"
"啟用 **Backface Culling** ，然後再次將場景匯出為 glTF。"

msgid "Depth Draw Mode"

"Test option below)."
msgstr ""
"**Never(從不):** 不進行深度抽取(不要將其與上面的No Depth Test(無深度測試)選項"

msgstr ""
"**Depth Pre-Pass(深度預通過):** 對於透明物體, 首先使用不透明部分進行不透明的"

msgid "No Depth Test"
msgstr "無深度測試"

msgid ""
"In order for close objects to appear over far away objects, depth testing is "
