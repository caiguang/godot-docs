msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"In a normal scenario, you would use a :ref:`MeshInstance3D "
"<class_MeshInstance3D>` node to display a 3D mesh like a human model for the "
"main character, but in some cases, you would like to create multiple "
"instances of the same mesh in a scene. You *could* duplicate the same node "
"multiple times and adjust the transforms manually. This may be a tedious "
"process and the result may look mechanical. Also, this method is not "
"conducive to rapid iterations. :ref:`MultiMeshInstance3D "
"<class_MultiMeshInstance3D>` is one of the possible solutions to this "
"problem."
msgstr ""
"在正常情況下, 使用一個 :ref:`MeshInstance <class_MeshInstance>` 節點來顯示一"
"個3D網格, 比如主角的人體模型, 但在某些情況下, 會想在一個場景中建立同一個網格"
"的多個實例. 你 *可以* 多次複製同一個節點, 並手動調整變換. 這可能是一個乏味的"
"過程, 結果可能看起來很機械. :ref:`MultiMeshInstance "
"<class_MultiMeshInstance>` 是解決這個問題的一種可能的方法."

msgid ""
"MultiMeshInstance3D, as the name suggests, creates multiple copies of a "
"MeshInstance over a surface of a specific mesh. An example would be having a "
"tree mesh populate a landscape mesh with trees of random scales and "
"orientations."
msgstr ""
"MultiMeshInstance, 顧名思義, 在特定網格的表面上建立MeshInstance的多個副本. 一"
"個範例是樹形網格用隨機比例和方向的樹填充景觀網格."

msgid "Setting up the nodes"
msgstr "設定節點"

msgid ""
"The basic setup requires three nodes: the MultiMeshInstance3D node and two "
"MeshInstance3D nodes."
msgstr ""
"基本設定需要三個節點：MultiMeshInstance3D 節點和兩個MeshInstance3D 節點。"

msgid ""
"One node is used as the target, the surface mesh that you want to place "
"multiple meshes on. In the tree example, this would be the landscape."
msgstr "一個節點用作目標, 即要放置多個網格的網格. 在樹的範例中, 這將是景觀."

msgid ""
"The other node is used as the source, the mesh that you want to have "
"duplicated. In the tree case, this would be the tree itself."
msgstr ""
"另一個節點是作為源節點, 也就是你想複製的網格. 在樹的情況下, 這將是樹本身."

msgid ""
"In our example, we would use a :ref:`Node3D <class_Node3D>` node as the root "
"node of the scene. Your scene tree would look like this:"
msgstr ""
"在我們的範例中，將使用 :ref:`Node3D <class_Node3D>` 作為場景的根節點。場景樹"
"看起來像這樣:"

msgid "For simplicity's sake, this tutorial uses built-in primitives."
msgstr "出於簡化目的，本教學使用內建像素。"

msgid ""
"Now you have everything ready. Select the MultiMeshInstance3D node and look "
"at the toolbar, you should see an extra button called ``MultiMesh`` next to "
"``View``. Click it and select *Populate surface* in the dropdown menu. A new "
"window titled *Populate MultiMesh* will pop up."
msgstr ""
"現在您準備好了一切。選擇 MultiMeshInstance3D 節點並查看工具列，您應該在``視圖"
"``旁邊看到一個名為 ``MultiMesh`` 的額外按鈕。按一下它並在下拉式功能表中選擇*"
"填充表面*。將彈出一個名為*填充MultiMesh*的新視窗。"

msgid "MultiMesh settings"
msgstr "MultiMesh 設定"

msgid "Below are descriptions of the options."
msgstr "以下是選項說明."

msgid "Target Surface"
msgstr "目標表面"

msgid ""
"The mesh used as the target surface on which to place copies of your source "
"mesh."
msgstr "用來放置源網格副本的目標表面的網格."

msgid "Source Mesh"
msgstr "源網格"

msgid "The mesh you want duplicated on the target surface."
msgstr "要在目標曲面上複製的網格."

msgid "Mesh Up Axis"
msgstr "網格向上軸"

msgid "The axis used as the up axis of the source mesh."
msgstr "軸用作源網格的上軸."

msgid "Random Rotation"
msgstr "隨機旋轉"

msgid "Randomizing the rotation around the up axis of the source mesh."
msgstr "隨機地圍繞源網格的向上軸旋轉."

msgid "Random Tilt"
msgstr "隨機磚塊"

msgid "Randomizing the overall rotation of the source mesh."
msgstr "隨機化源網格的整體旋轉."

msgid "Random Scale"
msgstr "隨機縮放"

msgid "Randomizing the scale of the source mesh."
msgstr "隨機化源網格的比例."

msgid "Scale"
msgstr "縮放"

msgid ""
"The scale of the source mesh that will be placed over the target surface."
msgstr "將放置在目標曲面上的源網格的比例."

msgid "Amount"
msgstr "數量"

msgid "The amount of mesh instances placed over the target surface."
msgstr "放置在目標曲面上的網格實例數量."

msgid ""
"Select the target surface. In the tree case, this should be the landscape "
"node. The source mesh should be the tree node. Adjust the other parameters "
"according to your preference. Press ``Populate`` and multiple copies of the "
"source mesh will be placed over the target mesh. If you are satisfied with "
"the result, you can delete the mesh instance used as the source mesh."
msgstr ""
"選擇目標曲面. 在樹情況下, 這應該是橫向節點. 源網格應該是樹節點. 根據您的喜好"
"調整其他參數. 按 ``Populate`` , 源網格的多個副本將放在目標網格上. 如果對結果"
"滿意, 可以刪除用作源網格的網格實例."

msgid "The end result should look like this:"
msgstr "最終結果應如下所示:"

msgid ""
"To change the result, repeat the previous steps with different parameters."
