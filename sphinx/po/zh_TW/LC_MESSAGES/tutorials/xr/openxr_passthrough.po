msgid "The OpenXR passthrough"
msgstr "穿透"

msgid ""
"Passthrough is a technique where camera images are used to present the "
"environment of the user as the background. This turns a VR headset into an "
"AR headset, often referred to as Mixed Reality or MR."
msgstr ""
"直通是一種使用相機影像將使用者的環境呈現為背景的技術。這會將 VR 耳機轉變為 "
"AR 耳機，通常稱為混合實境或 MR。"

msgid ""
"As passthrough is relatively new there isn't a singular way this is "
"implemented across platforms. There may be additions in the future so this "
"is a work in progress."
msgstr ""
"由於直通相對較新，因此沒有單一的跨平台實作方式。將來可能會有補充，所以這是一"
"項正在進行的工作。"

msgid "Passthrough extension"
msgstr "穿透"

msgid ""
"OpenXR has a vendor extension for passthrough submitted by Meta. Currently "
"this extension is only supported on Quest and PICO but may be adopted by "
"other headsets in the future."
msgstr ""
"OpenXR 有一個由 Meta 提交的直通的供應商擴充。目前此擴充僅在 Quest 和 PICO 上"
"支援，但將來可能會被其他耳機採用。"

msgid ""
":ref:`XRInterface <class_xrinterface>` has entry points for passthrough so "
"different interfaces can implement this feature. For :ref:`OpenXRInterface "
"<class_openxrinterface>` the meta passthrough extension is implemented here."
msgstr ""
":ref:`XRInterface <class_xrinterface>` 具有直通入口點，因此不同的介面可以實作"
"此功能。對於 OpenXRInterface <class_openxrinterface>`，元直通擴充在這裡實作。"

msgid ""
"In code you can call ``is_passthrough_supported`` to check if this extension "
"is available. If so you can simply enable passthrough by calling "
"``start_passthrough``. You can call ``stop_passthrough`` to disable "
"passthrough."
msgstr ""
"在程式碼中，您可以呼叫“is_passthrough_supported”來檢查此擴充功能是否可用。如"
"果是這樣，您只需呼叫“start_passthrough”即可啟用直通。您可以呼"
"叫“stop_passthrough”來停用直通。"

msgid ""
"You do need to make sure the background is transparent. You need to enable "
"the ``transparent_bg`` property on the viewport. Some background environment "
"settings will still fill the background with an opaque color, you can use a "
"``custom color`` with a color that has alpha set to 0."
msgstr ""
"您確實需要確保背景是透明的。您需要在視窗上啟用“transparent_bg”屬性。某些背景"
"環境設定仍會以不透明顏色填滿背景，您可以使用“自訂顏色”，其顏色的 alpha 設定"
"為 0。"

msgid "The OpenXR runtime will display the camera image as the background."
msgstr "OpenXR 運作時會顯示相機影像作為背景。"

msgid "For privacy reasons **no access** is given to the camera image."
msgstr "出於隱私原因**無法存取**相機影像。"

msgid ""
"After passthrough is enabled it is possible to change settings that will "
"break passthrough. Be sure not to disable the ``transparent_bg`` setting or "
"change the environment blend mode. This will result in the camera image no "
"longer being visible but you still incur the overhead."
msgstr ""
"啟用直通後，可以變更會中斷直通的設定。確保不要停用“transparent_bg”設定或更改"
"環境混合模式。這將導致相機影像不再可見，但您仍然會產生開銷。"

msgid "Always use ``stop_passthrough`` if you wish to turn off passthrough."
msgstr "如果您想關閉直通，請始終使用“stop_passthrough”。"

msgid ""
"Finally, for using passthrough on the Quest you must set the following "
"export property:"
msgstr "最後，要在 Quest 上使用直通，您必須設定以下匯出屬性："

msgid "Passthrough through AR"
msgstr "穿透"

msgid ""
"Some of the headsets recently adding OpenXR support have taken a different "
"approach. They simply mimic being an AR device. The Lynx R1 is such a device "
"but others may be doing the same."
msgstr ""
"最近新增 OpenXR 支援的一些耳機採取了不同的方法。他們只是模仿 AR 裝置。 Lynx "
"R1 就是這樣的裝置，但其他裝置可能也在做同樣的事情。"

msgid ""
"The following thus applies to both passthrough devices that mimic AR, and "
"actual AR devices."
msgstr "因此，以下內容適用於模仿 AR 的直通裝置和實際的 AR 裝置。"

msgid ""
"If ``is_passthrough_supported`` returns false the next step is to call "
"``get_supported_environment_blend_modes``. This will return a list of "
"supported blend modes for submitting the main render image to OpenXR."
msgstr ""
"如果「is_passthrough_supported」回傳 false，下一步是呼叫"
"「get_supported_environment_blend_modes」。這將返回支援的混合模式列表，用於將"
"主算繪圖像提交到 OpenXR。"

msgid ""
"We need to check if ``XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND`` is present in this "
"list. If so we can tell OpenXR to expect an image that can be alpha blended "
"with a background. To do this, we simply call "
"``set_environment_blend_mode(xr_interface.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND)``."
msgstr ""
"我們需要檢查此列表中是否存在「XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND」。如果是這樣，我"
"們可以告訴 OpenXR 期望圖像可以與背景進行 Alpha 混合。為此，我們只需呼叫"
"「set_environment_blend_mode(xr_interface.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND)」。"

msgid ""
"We must also set ``transparent_bg`` to true and adjust the environment to "
"ensure we submit the right image."
msgstr ""
"我們還必須將“transparent_bg”設為 true 並調整環境以確保我們提交正確的圖像。"

msgid "Putting it together"
msgstr "融會貫通"

msgid "Putting the above together we can use the following code as a base:"
msgstr "有下列事項需注意："

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
