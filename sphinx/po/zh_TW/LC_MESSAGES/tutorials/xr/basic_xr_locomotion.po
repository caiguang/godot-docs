msgid "Basic XR Locomotion"
msgstr "基礎 XR 運動"

msgid ""
"For basic locomotion we're going to continue using our Godot XR Tools "
"library. The library contains both basic movement features as more advanced "
"features."
msgstr ""
"對於基本運動，我們將繼續使用 Godot XR 工具庫。該庫既包含基本運動功能，也包含"
"更高級的功能。"

msgid "Adding our player body"
msgstr "新增更多節點"

msgid ""
"The first step we need to do is to add a helper node to our :ref:`XROrigin3D "
"<class_xrorigin3d>` node. Because XR supports roomscale tracking you can't "
"simply add your XR setup to a :ref:`CharacterBody3D <class_characterbody3d>` "
"node and expect things to work. You will run into trouble when the user "
"moves around their physical space and is no longer standing in the center of "
"their room. Godot XR Tools embeds the needed logic into a helper node called "
"``PlayerBody``."
msgstr ""
"我們需要做的第一步是為我們的 XROrigin3D <class_xrorigin3d> 節點新增一個輔助節"
"點。由於 XR 支援房間尺度跟踪，因此您不能簡單地將 XR 設定新增至 "
"CharacterBody3D <class_characterbody3d>` 節點並期望一切正常。當使用者在其實體"
"空間中移動並且不再站在房間的中心時，您將會遇到麻煩。 Godot XR Tools 將所需的"
"邏輯嵌入到名為「PlayerBody」的輔助節點中。"

msgid ""
"Select your :ref:`XROrigin3D <class_xrorigin3d>` node and click on the "
"``instantiate Child Scene`` button to add a child scene. Select ``addons/"
"godot-xr-tools/player/player_body.tscn`` and add this node."
msgstr ""
"選擇您的 XROrigin3D <class_xrorigin3d> 節點，然後按一下「實例化子場景」按鈕以"
"新增子場景。選擇“addons/godot-xr-tools/player/player_body.tscn”並新增此節點。"

msgid "Adding a floor"
msgstr "新增函式"

msgid ""
"This node governs the in game movement of your character and will "
"immediately react to gravity. So to prevent our player from infinitely "
"falling down we'll quickly add a floor to our scene."
msgstr ""
"該節點控制角色在遊戲中的移動，並會立即對重力做出反應。因此，為了防止玩家無限"
"下墜，我們將在場景中快速新增一個地板。"

msgid ""
"We start by adding a :ref:`StaticBody3D <class_staticbody3d>` node to our "
"root node and we rename this to ``Floor``. We add a :ref:`MeshInstance3D "
"<class_meshinstance3d>` node as a child node for our ``Floor``. Then create "
"a new :ref:`PlaneMesh <class_planemesh>` as it's mesh. For now we set the "
"size of the mesh to 100 x 100 meters. Next we add a :ref:`CollisionShape3D "
"<class_collisionshape3d>` node as a child node for our ``Floor``. Then "
"create a ``BoxShape`` as our shape. We set the size of this box shape to 100 "
"x 1 x 100 meters. We also need to move our collision shape down by 0.5 "
"meters so the top of our box is flush with the floor."
msgstr ""
"我們首先為根節點新增一個 StaticBody3D <class_staticbody3d> 節點，並將其重新命"
"名為「Floor」。我們新增一個 MeshInstance3D <class_meshinstance3d> 節點作為"
"「Floor」的子節點。然後建立一個新的 PlaneMesh <class_planemesh>` 作為網格。現"
"在我們將網格尺寸設定為 100 x 100 公尺。接下來，我們新增一個 CollisionShape3D "
"<class_collisionshape3d> 節點作為「Floor」的子節點。然後建立一個“BoxShape”作"
"為我們的形狀。我們將此盒子形狀的尺寸設定為 100 x 1 x 100 公尺。我們還需要將碰"
"撞形狀向下移動 0.5 米，以便盒子的頂部與地板齊平。"

msgid ""
"To make it easier to see that we're actually moving around our world, a "
"white floor isn't going to do it. For this we add a material to our "
"PlaneMesh and set the albedo to a grid texture we've created with `Wahooneys "
"excellent free texture generator <https://wahooney.itch.io/texture-grid-"
"generator>`_."
msgstr ""
"為了更容易看到我們實際上在世界各地移動，白色地板是無法做到這一點的。為此，我"
"們為 PlaneMesh 新增材質，並將反照率設定為我們使用「Wahooneys 優秀的免費紋理產"
"生器 <https://wahooney.itch.io/texture-grid-generator>」建立的網格紋理。"

msgid "Direct movement"
msgstr "字典"

msgid ""
"We're going to start adding some basic direct movement to our setup. This "
"allows the user to move through the virtual world using joystick input."
msgstr ""
"我們將開始在我們的設定中新增一些基本的直接運動。這允許使用者使用搖桿輸入在虛"
"擬世界中移動。"

msgid ""
"It is important to note that moving through the virtual world while the "
"player is standing still in the real world, can be nausea inducing "
"especially for players who are new to VR. The default settings on our "
"movement functions are fairly conservative. We advise you to stick to these "
"defaults but offer features in game to enable less comfortable settings for "
"more experienced users who are used to playing VR games."
msgstr ""
"值得注意的是，當玩家在現實世界中靜止不動時，在虛擬世界中移動可能會引起噁心，"
"尤其是對於剛接觸 VR 的玩家而言。我們的運動功能的預設相當保守。我們建議您堅持"
"這些預設設定，但在遊戲中提供一些功能，以便為習慣玩 VR 遊戲的經驗豐富的使用者"
"啟用不太舒適的設定。"

msgid ""
"We want to enable this on the right hand controller. We do this by adding a "
"subscene to the right hand :ref:`XRController3D <class_xrcontroller3d>` "
"node. Select ``addons/godot-xr-tools/functions/movement_direct.tscn`` as the "
"scene to add."
msgstr ""
"我們希望在右側控制器上啟用此功能。我們透過在右側 XRController3D "
"<class_xrcontroller3d> 節點新增一個子場景來實作此目的。選擇“addons/godot-xr-"
"tools/functions/movement_direct.tscn”作為要新增的場景。"

msgid ""
"This function adds forward and backwards movement to the player by using the "
"joystick on the right hand controller. It has an option to also add left/"
"right strafe but by default this is disabled."
msgstr ""
"此功能透過使用右側控制器上的操縱桿為玩家新增向前和向後移動。它還有一個選項可"
"以新增左/右平移，但預設情況下這是禁用的。"

msgid ""
"Instead, we are going to add the ability for the player to also turn with "
"this joystick. We will add another subscene to our controller node, select "
"``addons/godot-xr-tools/functions/movement_turn.tscn`` for this."
msgstr ""
"相反，我們將新增玩家使用該操縱桿轉動的功能。我們將向控制器節點新增另一個子場"
"景，為此選擇「addons/godot-xr-tools/functions/movement_turn.tscn」。"

msgid ""
"The turn system by default uses a snap turn approach. This means that "
"turning happens in steps. This may seem jarring however it is a tried and "
"tested method of combating motion sickness. You can easily switch to a mode "
"that offers smooth turning by changing the ``mode`` property on the turn "
"node."
msgstr ""
"轉彎系統預設使用快速轉彎方法。這意味著轉向是分步進行的。這可能看起來很刺耳，"
"但這是一種久經考驗的對抗暈動病的方法。您可以透過變更轉彎節點上的「mode」屬性"
"輕鬆切換到提供平滑轉彎的模式。"

msgid ""
"If you run your game at this point in time you will find that you can move "
"through the world freely using the right hand joystick."
msgstr ""
"如果你在這個時間點運作你的遊戲，你會發現你可以使用右手搖桿在世界中自由移動。"

msgid "Teleport"
msgstr "Teleport"

msgid ""
"An alternative to direct movement that some users find more pleasant is the "
"ability to teleport to another location within your game world. Godot XR "
"Tools supports this through the teleport function and we will be adding this "
"to our left hand controller."
msgstr ""
"有些使用者覺得更愉快的直接移動的替代方法是傳送到遊戲世界中的另一個位置。 "
"Godot XR Tools 透過傳送功能支援這一點，我們將把它新增到我們的左手控制器中。"

msgid ""
"Add a new child scene to your left hand :ref:`XRController3D "
"<class_xrcontroller3d>` node by selecting the ``addons/godot-xr-tools/"
"functions/function_teleport.tscn`` scene."
msgstr ""
"透過選擇「addons/godot-xr-tools/functions/function_teleport.tscn」場景，將新"
"的子場景新增至左手 XRController3D <class_xrcontroller3d>` 節點。"

msgid ""
"With this scene added the player will be able to teleport around the world "
"by pressing the trigger on the left hand controller, pointing where they "
"want to go, and then releasing the trigger. The player can also adjust the "
"orientation by using the left hand controllers joystick."
msgstr ""
"新增此場景後，玩家將能夠透過按下左手控制器上的觸發器，指向他們想去的地方，然"
"後釋放觸發器來傳送到世界各地。玩家還可以使用左手控制器操縱桿調整方向。"

msgid ""
"If you've followed all instructions correctly your scene should now look "
"something like this:"
msgstr "最後場景應該長這樣。"

msgid "More advanced movement features"
msgstr "更多高級移動功能"

msgid ""
"Godot XR Tools adds many more movement features such as gliding, a grapple "
"hook implementation, a jetpack, climbing mechanics, etc."
msgstr ""
"Godot XR 工具增加了更多的運動功能，如滑翔，抓鉤，噴氣背包，攀爬機制等。"

msgid ""
"Most work similarly to the basic movement features we've handled so far, "
"simply add the relevant subscene from the plugin to the controller that "
"implements it."
msgstr ""
"大多數工作原理與我們迄今為止處理的基本運動功能類似，只需將插件中的相關子場景"
"新增到實作它的控制器即可。"

msgid ""
"We'll look at some of these in more detail later on in this tutorial where "
"additional setup is required (such as climbing) but for others please look "
"at Godot XR Tools own help pages for details."
msgstr ""
"我們將在本教學後面更詳細地介紹其中一些需要額外設定（例如攀登）的內容，但對於"
"其他設定，請查看 Godot XR Tools 自己的幫助頁面以獲取詳細資訊。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
