"Out of the box Godot gives you all the basic support to setup an XR project. "
"XR specific game mechanics however need to be implemented on top of this "
"foundation. While Godot makes this relatively easy this can still be a "
"daunting task."
msgstr ""
"開箱即用的 Godot 為您提供設定 XR 專案的所有基本支援。然而，XR 特定的遊戲機制"
"需要在此基礎上實作。雖然 Godot 讓這相對容易，但這仍然是一項艱鉅的工作。"

"For this reason Godot has developed a toolkit called `Godot XR Tools "
"<https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools>`_ that implements many of the "
"basic mechanics found in XR games, from locomotion to object interaction to "
"UI interaction."
msgstr ""
"`Godot XR 工具 <https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools>`__是一個包含了若干"

"This toolkit is designed to work with both OpenXR and WebXR runtimes. We'll "
"be using this as a base for our documentation here. It helps developers hit "
"the ground running but for more specific use cases building your own logic "
"is just as valid. In that case XR tools can help in providing inspiration."
msgstr ""
"該工具包旨在與 OpenXR 和 WebXR 運作時配合使用。我們將使用它作為我們此處檔案的"
"基礎。它可以幫助開發人員立即開始運作，但對於更具體的用例，建立您自己的邏輯也"
"同樣有效。在這種情況下，XR 工具可以幫助提供靈感。"

msgid ""
"The current stable release of Godot XR Tools available on the Asset Library "
"is the version for Godot 3. The port of Godot XR Tools for Godot 4 is "
"available for download from the github website. We will walk through the "
"step of downloading and installing it here. We will update the documentation "
"once Godot XR Tools becomes available for Godot 4 through the asset library."

"Asset Library 上提供的 Godot XR Tools 目前穩定版本是 Godot 3 的版本。Godot 4 "

"As a reliable alternative Godot XR Tools comes with a number of rigged hand "

"come in low and high poly versions, come in a few configurations, a number "
