"It is often desired to use SSL connections for communications to avoid \"man "
"in the middle\" attacks. Godot has a connection wrapper, :ref:`StreamPeerTLS "
"<class_StreamPeerTLS>`, which can take a regular connection and add security "
"around it. The :ref:`HTTPClient <class_HTTPClient>` class also supports "
"HTTPS by using this same wrapper."
msgstr ""
"通常希望使用 SSL 連接進行通信，可以避免“中間人”攻擊。Godot 有一個連接包裝器 :"
"ref:`StreamPeerSSL <class_StreamPeerSSL>`，它可以進行更安全的連接。:ref:"
"`HTTPClient <class_HTTPClient>` 類也通過使用相同的包裝器來支援 HTTPS。"

"Godot includes SSL certificates from Mozilla, but you can provide your own "
"with a .crt file in the project settings:"
msgstr ""
"Godot包括了來自Mozilla的SSL憑證, 但你可以在專案設定中用.crt檔提供你自己的:"

msgid ""
"This file should contain any number of public certificates in `PEM format "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail>`__."
msgstr ""
"該檔應包含任意數量的 `PEM 格式的公共憑證 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail>`__ ."

msgid ""
"Of course, remember to add .crt as filter so the exporter recognizes this "
"when exporting your project."
msgstr "當然, 請記住將.crt新增為篩檢程式, 以便匯出器在匯出專案時識別這一點."

msgid "There are two ways to obtain certificates:"
msgstr "獲取憑證有兩種方法:"

msgid "Approach 1: self signed cert"
msgstr "方法 1：自簽章憑證"

msgid ""
"The first approach is the simplest: generate a private and public key pair "
"and add the public key (in PEM format) to the .crt file. The private key "
"should go to your server."
msgstr ""
"第一種方法最簡單: 生成一個私密金鑰和公開金鑰對, 並將公開金鑰(PEM格式)新增到."
"crt檔案中. 私密金鑰應該放到你的伺服器上."

msgid ""
"OpenSSL has `some documentation <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/"
"openssl/master/doc/HOWTO/keys.txt>`__ about this. This approach also **does "
"not require domain validation** nor requires you to spend a considerable "
"amount of money in purchasing certificates from a CA."
msgstr ""
"OpenSSL有 `一些文件 <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/openssl/"
"master/doc/HOWTO/keys.txt>`__ 談到這些. 這種方法也 **不需要功能變數名稱驗證"
"** 也不要求您花費現金從CA購買憑證."

msgid "Approach 2: CA cert"
msgstr "方法 2：CA 憑證"

msgid ""
"The second approach consists of using a certificate authority (CA) such as "
"Verisign, Geotrust, etc. This is a more cumbersome process, but it's more "
"\"official\" and ensures your identity is clearly represented."
msgstr ""
"第二種方法是借助 Verisign、Geotrust 等憑證授權（CA）。這是一個更加繁瑣的過"
"程，但它更加“正式”並且可以確保您的身份被清晰地表示。"

msgid ""
"Unless you are working with large companies or corporations, or need to "
"connect to someone else's servers (i.e., connecting to Google or some other "
"REST API provider via HTTPS), this method is not as useful."
msgstr ""
"除非你與大公司或企業合作, 或需要連接到別人的伺服器(即通過HTTPS連接到穀歌或其"
"他REST API供應商), 否則這種方法就不那麼有用."

msgid ""
"Also, when using a CA issued cert, **you must enable domain validation**, to "
"ensure the domain you are connecting to is the one intended, otherwise any "
"website can issue any certificate in the same CA and it will work."
msgstr ""
"此外, 當使用CA頒發的憑證時, **您必須啟用功能變數名稱驗證** , 以確保您要連接的"
"功能變數名稱是您想連接的功能變數名稱, 否則一個CA頒發的憑證將會成功用到任意數"
"量的網站中."

msgid ""
"If you are using Linux, you can use the supplied certs file, generally "
"located in:"
msgstr "如果您使用的是Linux, 則可以使用系統提供的憑證檔, 通常位於:"

msgid ""
"This file allows HTTPS connections to virtually any website (i.e., Google, "
"Microsoft, etc.)."
msgstr "此檔允許HTTPS連接到幾乎任何網站(即Google,Microsoft等)."

msgid ""
"Or pick any of the more specific certificates there if you are connecting to "
"a specific one."
msgstr "或者, 如果要連接到特定網站, 請選擇任何更加具體的憑證."

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
