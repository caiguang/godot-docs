msgid ""
"As you might have already read in :ref:`doc_audio_buses`, sound is sent to "
"each bus via an AudioStreamPlayer node. There are different kinds of "
"AudioStreamPlayers. Each one loads an AudioStream and plays it back."
msgstr ""
"正如你可能已經在 :ref:`doc_audio_buses` 中讀到的一樣, 聲音通過"
"AudioStreamPlayer節點發送到每個匯流排.AudioStreamPlayer有很多種. 每一個都會載"
"入一個AudioStream並進行播放."

msgid "AudioStream"
msgstr "AudioStream"

msgid ""
"An audio stream is an abstract object that emits sound. The sound can come "
"from many places, but is most commonly loaded from the filesystem. Audio "
"files can be loaded as AudioStreams and placed inside an AudioStreamPlayer. "
"You can find information on supported formats and differences in :ref:"
"`doc_importing_audio_samples`."
msgstr ""
"音訊流(audio stream)是一種發出聲音的抽象物件. 聲音可以來自許多地方, 最常見的"
"是從檔案系統載入. 音訊檔可以作為AudioStreams載入並放置在AudioStreamPlayer中. "
"你可以在 :ref:`doc_importing_audio_samples` 中找到有關支援的格式和格式差異的"
"資訊."

msgid ""
"There are other types of AudioStreams, such as AudioStreamRandomPitch. This "
"one makes a random adjustment to the sound's pitch every time it's played "
"back. This can be helpful for adding variation to sounds that are played "
"back often."
msgstr ""
"AudioStream有不同的型別, 例如AudioStreamRandomPitch, 它在每次播放聲音時隨機調"
"整音高(對於某些音效非常有用), 可以為頻繁播放的聲音增加一些變化."

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer"

msgid ""
"This is the standard, non-positional stream player. It can play to any bus. "
"In 5.1 sound setups, it can send audio to stereo mix or front speakers."
msgstr ""
"這是一個標準的, 非位置型的流播放機, 可以播放到任意匯流排. 在5.1身歷聲中, 它可"
"以將音訊發送到身歷聲混音或前置揚聲器."

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer2D"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer2D"

msgid ""
"This is a variant of AudioStreamPlayer, but emits sound in a 2D positional "
"environment. When close to the left of the screen, the panning will go left. "
"When close to the right side, it will go right."
msgstr ""
"這是AudioStreamPlayer的一種變體, 它將聲音發散到2D位置環境中. 當靠近螢幕左側"
"時, 聲像將向左偏移. 靠近右側時, 則向右偏移."

msgid ""
"Area2Ds can be used to divert sound from any AudioStreamPlayer2Ds they "
"contain to specific buses. This makes it possible to create buses with "
"different reverb or sound qualities to handle action happening in a "
"particular parts of your game world."
msgstr ""
"Area2D可以將它們包含的AudioStreamPlayer2D的聲音轉移到特定的匯流排上. 這樣就可"
"以創造具有不同混響或聲音品質的匯流排, 從而處理在遊戲世界的特定區域中發生的動"
"作."

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer3D"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer3D"

msgid ""
"This is a variant of AudioStreamPlayer, but emits sound in a 3D positional "
"environment. Depending on the location of the player relative to the screen, "
"it can position sound in stereo, 5.1 or 7.1 depending on the chosen audio "
"setup."
msgstr ""
"這是AudioStreamPlayer的一種變體, 它將聲音發散到3D位置環境中. 根據播放機相對於"
"螢幕的位置, 它可以將聲音定位在身歷聲(5.1或7.1)中, 具體取決於所選的音訊設定."

msgid ""
"Similar to AudioStreamPlayer2D, an Area can divert the sound to an audio bus."
msgstr "類似AudioStreamPlayer2D,Area可以將聲音轉移到音訊匯流排上."

msgid ""
"Unlike for 2D, the 3D version of AudioStreamPlayer has a few more advanced "
"options:"
msgstr "與2D不同,AudioStreamPlayer的3D版本有一些更高級的選項:"

msgid "Reverb buses"
msgstr "混響匯流排"

msgid ""
"Godot allows for 3D audio streams that enter a specific Area node to send "
"dry and wet audio to separate buses. This is useful when you have several "
"reverb configurations for different types of rooms. This is done by enabling "
"this type of reverb in the **Reverb Bus** section of the Area's properties:"
msgstr ""
"Godot允許進入特定Area節點的3D音訊流將幹音訊和濕音訊發送到不同的匯流排上. 當你"
"為不同型別的房間設定不同的混響配置時十分有用. 這是通過在Area屬性的 **Reverb "
"Bus** 部分中啟用此類混響來實作的:"

msgid ""
"At the same time, a special bus layout is created where each area receives "
"the reverb info from each area. A Reverb effect needs to be created and "
"configured in each reverb bus to complete the setup for the desired effect:"
msgstr ""
"同時, 還建立了一個特殊的匯流排佈局, 每個區域都接收各自的混響資訊. 最後需要在"
"每條匯流排中建立並配置一個實際的混響效果, 才能完成所需效果的設定:"

msgid ""
"The Area's **Reverb Bus** section also has a parameter named **Uniformity**. "
"Some types of rooms bounce sounds more than others (like a warehouse), so "
"reverberation can be heard almost uniformly across the room even though the "
"source may be far away. Playing around with this parameter can simulate that "
"effect."
msgstr ""
"Area的 **Reverb Bus** 部分還有一個名為 **Uniformity** (均勻性)的參數. 有些型"
"別的房間比其他型別的房間反彈的聲音更多(例如倉庫), 因此即使聲源離得很遠, 也能"
"在整個房間裡聽到幾乎均勻的混響. 調整此參數可以模擬這種效果."

msgid "Doppler"
msgstr "多普勒"

msgid ""
"When the relative velocity between an emitter and listener changes, this is "
"perceived as an increase or decrease in the pitch of the emitted sound. "
"Godot can track velocity changes in the AudioStreamPlayer3D and Camera "
"nodes. Both nodes have this property, which must be enabled manually:"
msgstr ""
"當發射源和接收者之間的相對速度發生變化時, 發出聲音的音高會隨之升高/降低.Godot"
"可以追蹤AudioStreamPlayer3D和Camera節點的速度變化. 這兩個節點都有這個屬性, 需"
"要手動啟用:"

msgid ""
"Enable it by setting it depending on how objects will be moved: use **Idle** "
"for objects moved using ``_process``, or **Physics** for objects moved using "
"``_physics_process``. The tracking will happen automatically."
msgstr ""
"根據物件的移動方法選擇啟用設定: 如果用 ``_process`` 來移動, 選擇 **Idle** ；"
"如果使用 ``_physics_process`` 來移動, 選擇 **Physics** . 追蹤將自動進行."

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
