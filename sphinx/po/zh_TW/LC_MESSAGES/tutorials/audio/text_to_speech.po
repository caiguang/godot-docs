"Godot depends on system libraries for text-to-speech functionality. These "
"libraries are installed by default on Windows and macOS, but not on all "

"Godot 依賴系統函式庫來實作文字轉語音功能。這些函式庫預設安裝在 Windows 和 "

"The best practices for text-to-speech, in terms of the ideal player "
"experience for blind players, is to send output to the player's screen "
"reader. This preserves the choice of language, speed, pitch, etc. that the "
"user set, as well as allows advanced features like allowing players to "
"scroll backward and forward through text. As of now, Godot doesn't provide "
"this level of integration."
msgstr ""
"就盲人玩家的理想玩家體驗而言，文字轉語音的最佳實踐是將輸出發送到玩家的螢幕閱"
"讀器。這保留了使用者設定的語言、速度、音調等的選擇，並允許高級功能，例如允許"
"玩家向後和向前滾動文字。截至目前，Godot 還沒有提供這種程度的整合。"

"With the current state of the Godot text-to-speech APIs, best practices "

"This provides your blind players with the most flexibility and comfort "

"Expect delays when you call `tts_speak` and `tts_stop`. The actual delay "
"time varies depending on both the OS and on your machine's specifications. "
"This is especially critical on Android and Web, where some of the voices "
"depend on web services, and the actual time to playback depends on server "
"load, network latency, and other factors."
msgstr ""
"當您呼叫“tts_speak”和“tts_stop”時，預計會出現延遲。實際延遲時間根據作業系統和"
"機器規格而有所不同。這對於 Android 和 Web 來說尤其重要，其中一些語音依賴 Web "
"服務，實際播放時間取決於伺服器負載、網路延遲和其他因素。"
