msgid "Audio buses"
msgstr "音訊匯流排"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Godot's audio processing code has been written with games in mind, with the "
"aim of achieving an optimal balance between performance and sound quality."
msgstr "Godot的音訊處理程式碼是為了遊戲而寫的, 以達到性能和音質之間的最佳平衡."

msgid ""
"Godot's audio engine allows any number of audio buses to be created and any "
"number of effect processors can be added to each bus. Only the hardware of "
"the device running your game will limit the number of buses and effects that "
"can be used before performance starts to suffer."
msgstr ""
"Godot的音訊引擎允許建立任意數量的音訊匯流排, 並且可以向每個匯流排新增任意數量"
"的效果處理器. 運作遊戲的裝置的硬體會限制匯流排的數量, 以及在性能開始下降之前"
"可以使用的效果."

msgid "Decibel scale"
msgstr "分貝標度"

msgid ""
"Godot's sound interface is designed to meet the expectations of sound design "
"professionals. To this end, it primarily uses the decibel scale."
msgstr ""
"Godot的聲音介面是為了滿足聲音設計專業人士的期望而設計的. 因此主要採用分貝標"
"度."

msgid "For those unfamiliar with it, it can be explained with a few facts:"
msgstr "對於那些不熟悉它的人, 可以用一些事實來解釋:"

msgid ""
"The decibel (dB) scale is a relative scale. It represents the ratio of sound "
"power by using 20 times the base 10 logarithm of the ratio (20 × log\\ :sub:"
"`10`\\ (P/P\\ :sub:`0`\\ ))."
msgstr ""
"分貝（dB）標度是一個相對標度.它等於聲功率比的常用對數的20倍（20 × log\\ ："
"sub：'10'\\ （P/P/\\ ：sub：'0'\\ ））。"

msgid ""
"For every 6 dB, sound amplitude doubles or halves. 12 dB represents a factor "
"of 4, 18 dB a factor of 8, 20 dB a factor of 10, 40 dB a factor of 100, etc."
msgstr ""
"每增/減6分貝, 聲幅就會加倍/減半.12dB代表係數4,18dB代表係數8,20dB代表係數"
"10,40dB代表係數100, 以此類推."

msgid ""
"Since the scale is logarithmic, true zero (no audio) can't be represented."
msgstr "由於比例是對數的, 因此無法表示真零(無音訊)."

msgid ""
"0 dB is the maximum amplitude possible in a digital audio system. This limit "
"is not the human limit, but a limit from the sound hardware. Audio with "
"amplitudes that are too high to be represented properly below 0 dB create a "
"kind of distortion called *clipping*."
msgstr ""
"0 dB 是數位音訊系統中可能的最大振幅. 這個限制不是人為的限制, 而是聲音硬體的限"
"制. 因振幅太高而無法完全反映在0dB以下的音訊, 會產生一種被稱為 *削波* 的失真."

msgid ""
"To avoid clipping, your sound mix should be arranged so that the output of "
"the *master bus* (more on that later) never exceeds 0 dB."
msgstr ""
"為了避免削波，你應該調整混音，使*master 匯流排*（後面會有更多的介紹）永遠不超"
"過 0 dB。"

msgid ""
"Every 6 dB below the 0 dB limit, sound energy is *halved*. It means the "
"sound volume at -6 dB is half as loud as 0dB. -12 dB is half as loud as -6 "
"dB and so on."
msgstr ""
"低於0dB限制的每6dB, 聲能就會 *減半* . 這意味著-6dB的音量是0dB的一半. -12dB"
"是-6dB的一半, 依此類推."

msgid ""
"When working with decibels, sound is considered no longer audible between "
"-60 dB and -80 dB. This makes your working range generally between -60 dB "
"and 0 dB."
msgstr ""
"使用分貝時, -60dB和-80dB範圍內的聲音被認為是聽不見的. 也就是說你的工作範圍一"
"般在-60dB和0dB之間."

msgid ""
"This can take a bit getting used to, but it's friendlier in the end and will "
"allow you to communicate better with audio professionals."
msgstr ""
"這可能需要一點時間來習慣, 但最終會變得友好, 並且可以讓您與音訊專業人員更好地"
"進行交流."

msgid "Audio buses can be found in the bottom panel of the Godot editor:"
msgstr "音訊匯流排可以在Godot 編輯器的底部面板中找到:"

msgid ""
"An *audio bus* (also called an *audio channel*) can be considered a place "
"that audio is channeled through on the way to playback through a device's "
"speakers. Audio data can be *modified* and *re-routed* by an audio bus. An "
"audio bus has a VU meter (the bars that light up when sound is played) which "
"indicates the amplitude of the signal passing through."
msgstr ""
"*音訊匯流排* (audio bus)(通常也稱為 *音訊通道* (audio channel) )是音訊從揚聲"
"器播放出來之前通過的地方. 它可以 *修改* 和 *重路由* 音訊資料. 音訊匯流排有一"
"個 VU表(播放聲音時亮起的條形), 表示通過的訊號的幅度."

msgid ""
"The leftmost bus is the *master bus*. This bus outputs the mix to your "
"speakers so, as mentioned in the *Decibel scale* section above, make sure "
"that your mix level doesn't reach 0 dB in this bus. The rest of the audio "
"buses can be flexibly routed. After modifying the sound, they send it to "
"another bus to the left. The destination bus can be specified for each of "
"the non-master audio buses. Routing always passes audio from buses on the "
"right to buses further to the left. This avoids infinite routing loops."
msgstr ""
"最左邊的匯流排是 *主匯流排* . 此匯流排將混音輸出到你的揚聲器, 因此, 正如之前 "
"*分貝標度* 部分所述, 請確保主匯流排中的混音水平永遠低於 0 dB. 其餘的音訊匯流"
"排可以靈活地進行路由. 在修改聲音後, 它們會將其發送到左邊的另一條匯流排上. 非"
"主匯流排的目標匯流排可以被單獨設定. 而右側匯流排的音訊會被路由至左側匯流排, "
"這避免了無限迴圈."

msgid ""
"In the above image, the output of *Bus 2* has been routed to the *Master* "
"bus."
msgstr "在上圖中, *Bus 2* 的輸出被路由到了 *主* 匯流排."

msgid "Playback of audio through a bus"
msgstr "通過匯流排播放音訊"

msgid ""
"To test passing audio to a bus, create an AudioStreamPlayer node, load an "
"AudioStream and select a target bus for playback:"
msgstr ""
"要測試將音訊傳遞到匯流排, 請建立AudioStreamPlayer節點, 載入AudioStream並選擇"
"要播放的目標匯流排:"

msgid "Finally, toggle the **Playing** property to **On** and sound will flow."
msgstr "最後將 **Playing** 屬性勾上 **On** , 聲音就開始播放了."

msgid ""
"You may also be interested in reading about :ref:`doc_audio_streams` now."
msgstr "你現在可能有興趣閱讀 :ref:`doc_audio_streams`。"

msgid "Adding effects"
msgstr "新增特效"

msgid ""
"Audio buses can contain all sorts of effects. These effects modify the sound "
"in one way or another and are applied in order."
msgstr "音訊匯流排可以包含各種效果. 這些效果以某種方式修改聲音並按順序應用."

msgid "For information on what each effect does, see :ref:`doc_audio_effects`."
msgstr "更多有關光照烘焙的資訊，請參考 :ref:`doc_baked_lightmaps` 。"

msgid "Automatic bus disabling"
msgstr "自動匯流排禁用"

msgid ""
"There is no need to disable buses manually when not in use. Godot detects "
"that the bus has been silent for a few seconds and disables it (including "
"all effects)."
msgstr ""
"你不需要手動禁用閒置匯流排,Godot在偵測到匯流排已經靜音數秒之後, 就會禁用它(以"
"及所有效果)."

msgid "Disabled buses have a blue VU meter instead of a red-green one."
msgstr "已禁用的匯流排VU表為藍色, 而不是紅綠色."

msgid "Bus rearrangement"
msgstr "匯流排重排"

msgid ""
"Stream Players use bus names to identify a bus, which allows adding, "
"removing and moving buses around while the reference to them is kept. "
"However, if a bus is renamed, the reference will be lost and the Stream "
"Player will output to Master. This system was chosen because rearranging "
"buses is a more common process than renaming them."
msgstr ""
"流播放機使用匯流排名稱來識別匯流排, 允許在保留對匯流排的引用時新增, 刪除和移"
"動匯流排. 然而, 重命名匯流排會導致引用丟失, 流播放機將輸出到主匯流排. 之所以"
"選擇這個系統, 是因為重新排列匯流排相比重命名匯流排更為常用."

msgid "Default bus layout"
msgstr "預設匯流排佈局"

msgid ""
"The default bus layout is automatically saved to the ``res://"
"default_bus_layout.tres`` file. Custom bus arrangements can be saved and "
"loaded from disk."
msgstr ""
"預設的匯流排佈局會自動保存到 ``res:// default_bus_layout.tres`` 檔案中. 自訂"
"匯流排佈局可以從磁片中保存和載入."

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
