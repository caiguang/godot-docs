msgid "Audio effects"
msgstr "音效"

msgid ""
"Godot includes several audio effects that can be added to an audio bus to "
"alter every sound file that goes through that bus."
msgstr ""
"Godot 包含多種音訊效果，可以將它們新增到音訊匯流排以更改通過該匯流排的每個音"
"訊檔。"

msgid ""
"Try them all out to get a sense of how they alter sound. Here follows a "
"short description of the available effects:"
msgstr "全部試一試，感受聲音的改變。下面是對以上效果的簡短描述:"

msgid "Amplify"
msgstr "增幅(Amplify)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Amplify changes the volume of the signal. Some care needs to be taken, "
"though: setting the level too high can make the sound digitally clip, which "
"can produce unpleasant crackles and pops."
msgstr ""
"增幅改變訊號的振幅。使用時要小心。把電平調得太高的話，聲音就會被削波，這通常"
"是不可取的."

msgid "BandLimit and BandPass"
msgstr "帶限和帶通(BandLimit and BandPass)"

msgid ""
"These are resonant filters which block frequencies around the *Cutoff* "
"point. BandPass can be used to simulate sound passing through an old "
"telephone line or megaphone. Modulating the BandPass frequency can simulate "
"the sound of a wah-wah guitar pedal, think of the guitar in Jimi Hendrix's "
"*Voodoo Child (Slight Return)*."
msgstr ""
"它們是共振濾波器，在 *截斷* (Cutoff)點附近阻斷頻率。帶通濾波器可以用來類比舊"
"電話線路或擴音器傳出的聲音。調節帶通濾波器的頻率，可以類比吉他哇音(wah-wah)踏"
"板的聲音，想想吉米•亨德里克斯在 *Voodoo Child (Slight Return)* 中使用的吉他"
"吧。"

msgid "Capture"
msgstr "截取"

msgid ""
"The Capture effect copies the audio frames of the audio bus that it is on "
"into an internal buffer. This can be used to capture data from the "
"microphone or to transmit audio over the network in real-time."
msgstr ""
"Capture（採集）效果器會將其所在音訊匯流排的音訊影格複製到內部緩衝區中。可用於"
"從麥克風獲取音訊或通過網路即時傳輸音訊。"

msgid "Chorus"
msgstr "和聲"

msgid ""
"As the name of the effect implies, the Chorus effect makes a single audio "
"sample sound like an entire chorus. It does this by duplicating a signal and "
"very slightly altering the timing and pitch of each duplicate, and varying "
"that over time via an LFO (low frequency oscillator). The duplicate(s) are "
"then mixed back together with the original signal, producing a lush, wide, "
"and large sound. Although chorus is traditionally used for voices, it can be "
"desirable with almost any type of sound."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compressor"
msgstr "壓縮(Compressor)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"A dynamic range compressor automatically attenuates (ducks) the level of the "
"incoming signal when its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The level of "
"attenuation applied is proportional to how far the incoming audio exceeds "
"the threshold. The compressor's Ratio parameter controls the degree of "
"attenuation. One of the main uses of a compressor is to reduce the dynamic "
"range of signals with very loud and quiet parts. Reducing the dynamic range "
"of a signal can make it fit more comfortably in a mix."
msgstr ""
"當輸入訊號的幅度超過某一閾值時，動態範圍壓縮器會自動衰減該訊號的電平。衰減的"
"程度與傳入的音訊超過閾值的程度成正比。壓縮器的 \"比例\" 參數控制衰減的係數。"
"壓縮器的主要用途之一是，一個訊號具有非常大聲和小聲的部分時，壓縮器可以用於降"
"低動態範圍。降低訊號的動態範圍會更方便混音。"

msgid "The compressor has many uses. For example:"
msgstr "壓縮器有很多用途，例如:"

msgid ""
"It can be used in the Master bus to compress the whole output prior to being "
"hit by a limiter, making the effect of the limiter much more subtle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It can be used in voice channels to ensure they sound as even as possible."
msgstr "它可以在人聲通道中使用，使它們聽起來盡可能均勻。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"It can be *sidechained* by another sound source. This means it can reduce "
"the sound level of one signal using the level of another audio bus for "
"threshold detection. This technique is very common in video game mixing to "
"\"duck\" the level of music or sound effects when in-game or multiplayer "
"voices need to be fully audible."
msgstr ""
"它可以用於 *側鏈壓縮* (Sidechained)。也就是說, 它可以利用另一個音訊匯流排的電"
"平來降低一個訊號的電平，進行閾值偵測。這種技術在電子遊戲混音中非常常見。在出"
"現語音時，音樂或音效的電平會被 \"降低\"。"

msgid ""
"It can accentuate transients by using a slower attack. This can make sound "
"effects more punchy."
msgstr "它可以通過較慢的啟動(attack)來突出瞬態，讓音效聽起來更有力。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"If your goal is to prevent a signal from exceeding a given amplitude "
"altogether, rather than to reduce the dynamic range of the signal, a :ref:"
"`limiter <doc_audio_buses_limiter>` is likely a better choice than a "
"compressor for this purpose. However, applying compression before a limiter "
"is still good practice."
msgstr ""
"如果你的目標是防止電平訊號超過某個振幅限度，而不是減少訊號的動態範圍……那麼, :"
"ref:`限幅器 (limiter)<doc_audio_buses_limiter>` 可能是比壓縮器更好的選擇。"

msgid "Delay"
msgstr "延遲"

msgid ""
"Digital delay essentially duplicates a signal and repeats it at a specified "
"speed with a volume level that decays for each repeat. Delay is great for "
"simulating the acoustic space of a canyon or large room, where sound bounces "
"have a lot of *delay* between their repeats. This is in contrast to reverb, "
"which has a more natural and blurred sound to it. Using this in conjunction "
"with reverb can create very natural sounding environments!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Distortion"
msgstr "失真(Distortion)"

msgid "Makes the sound distorted. Godot offers several types of distortion:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Overdrive* sounds like a guitar distortion pedal or megaphone. Sounds "
"distorted with this sound like they're coming through a low-quality speaker "
"or device."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Tan* sounds like another interesting flavor of overdrive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Bit crushing* clamps the amplitude of the signal, making it sound flat and "
"crunchy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All three types of distortion can add higher frequency sounds to an original "
"sound, making it stand out better in a mix."
msgstr ""

msgid "EQ"
msgstr "等化器(EQ)"

msgid ""
"EQ is what all other equalizers inherit from. It can be extended with Custom "
"scripts to create an equalizer with a custom number of bands."
msgstr ""
"所有其他等化器都從EQ繼承而來。可以使用自訂腳本將其擴充，以此建立具有自訂頻段"
"數的等化器。"

msgid "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"
msgstr "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Godot provides three equalizers with different numbers of bands, which are "
"represented in the title (6, 10, and 21 bands, respectively). An equalizer "
"on the Master bus can be useful for cutting low and high frequencies that "
"the device's speakers can't reproduce well. For example, phone or tablet "
"speakers usually don't reproduce low frequency sounds well, and could make a "
"limiter or compressor attenuate sounds that aren't even audible to the user "
"anyway."
msgstr ""
"Godot提供三個具有不同頻帶數的等化器。主匯流排上的等化器可以有效地削減裝置揚聲"
"器不能很好地再現的頻率(例如, 手機揚聲器不能很好地再現低音部分)。插入耳機時可"
"以禁用等化器效果."

msgid ""
"Note: The equalizer effect can be disabled when headphones are plugged in, "
"giving the user the best of both worlds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Filter"
msgstr "篩選"

msgid ""
"Filter is what all other filters inherit from and should not be used "
"directly."
msgstr "濾波器是所有其他處理器繼承自的效果，不能直接使用。"

msgid "HighPassFilter"
msgstr "Filter - 篩選"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency. HighPassFilter is used "
"to reduce the bass content of a signal."
msgstr ""
"這些濾波器削減低於特定 *截斷* 頻率的頻率. 高通濾波器用於降低訊號的低音含量。"

msgid "HighShelfFilter"
msgstr "高架濾波器(HighShelfFilter)"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "減少所有高於特定 *截斷* 值的頻率。"

msgid "Limiter"
msgstr "限幅器(Limiter)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"A limiter is similar to a compressor, but it's less flexible and designed to "
"prevent a signal's amplitude exceeding a given dB threshold. Adding a "
"limiter to the final point of the Master bus is good practice, as it offers "
"an easy safeguard against clipping."
msgstr ""
"限幅器類似於壓縮器，但靈活性較差，功能是限制聲音不能超過給定的dB閾值。在主匯"
"流排上新增一個限制器是防止削波的防護措施。"

msgid "LowPassFilter"
msgstr "Filter - 篩選"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency and can also resonate "
"(boost frequencies close to the *Cutoff* frequency). Low pass filters can be "
"used to simulate \"muffled\" sound. For instance, underwater sounds, sounds "
"blocked by walls, or distant sounds."
msgstr ""
"削減高於特定 *截斷* 頻率的頻率，也可以產生共振(加強接近 *截斷* 頻率的頻率)。"
"低通濾波器可以用來模擬 \"沉悶\" 的聲音。例如，水下的聲音, 牆後的聲音或遙遠的"
"聲音。"

msgid "LowShelfFilter"
msgstr "Filter - 篩選"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "削減所有低於特定 *截斷* 值的頻率。"

msgid "NotchFilter"
msgstr "陷波濾波器(NotchFilter)"

msgid ""
"The opposite of the BandPassFilter, it removes a band of sound from the "
"frequency spectrum at a given *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "與帶通濾波器相反, 它從頻譜中的給定的 *截斷* 處移除一個頻段的聲音."

msgid "Panner"
msgstr "聲像(Panner)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The Panner allows the stereo balance of a signal to be adjusted between the "
"left and right channels. Headphones are recommended when configuring in this "
"effect."
msgstr "聲像效果允許在左右通道之間調整訊號的身歷聲平衡(戴上耳機試聽這個效果)。"

msgid "Phaser"
msgstr "移相器(Phaser)"

msgid ""
"This effect is formed by de-phasing two duplicates of the same sound so they "
"cancel each other out in an interesting way. Phaser produces a pleasant "
"whooshing sound that moves back and forth through the audio spectrum, and "
"can be a great way to create sci-fi effects or Darth Vader-like voices."
msgstr ""

msgid "PitchShift"
msgstr "移調(PitchShift)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"This effect allows the adjustment of the signal's pitch independently of its "
"speed. All frequencies can be increased/decreased with minimal effect on "
"transients. PitchShift can be useful to create unusually high or deep "
"voices. Do note that altering pitch can sound unnatural when pushed outside "
"of a narrow window."
msgstr ""
"這種效果允許在不改變速度的前提下改變音調，可以用對瞬態的影響最小的方式增/減所"
"有頻率，移調可以用來創作特別尖銳或低沉的聲音。"

msgid "Record"
msgstr "錄製(Record)"

msgid "The Record effect allows the user to record sound from a microphone."
msgstr "Record 效果允許使用者錄製麥克風中的聲音。"

msgid "Reverb"
msgstr "混響(Reverb)"

msgid ""
"Reverb simulates rooms of different sizes. It has adjustable parameters that "
"can be tweaked to obtain the sound of a specific room. Reverb is commonly "
"outputted from :ref:`Area3Ds <class_Area3D>` (see :ref:`Reverb buses "
"<doc_audio_streams_reverb_buses>`), or to apply a \"chamber\" feel to all "
"sounds."
msgstr ""
"混響可以模擬不同大小的房間. 可以調整各種參數以獲得特定房間的聲效. 混響通常"
"從 :ref:`Areas <class_Area>` 輸出(見 :ref:`Reverb buses "
"<doc_audio_streams_reverb_buses>`), 或對所有聲音施加一個 \"室內\" 的感覺."

msgid "SpectrumAnalyzer"
msgstr "頻譜分析儀(SpectrumAnalyzer)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"This effect doesn't alter audio, instead, you add this effect to buses you "
"want a spectrum analysis of. This would typically be used for audio "
"visualization. Visualizing voices can be a great way to draw attention to "
"them without just increasing their volume. A demo project using this can be "
"found `here <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/"
"audio/spectrum>`__."
msgstr ""
"這個效果並不會改變音訊, 你可以把這個效果新增到你想要分析頻譜的匯流排上. 通常"
"被用於音訊視覺化. 使用了這個效果的演示專案可在 `這裡 <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/audio/spectrum>`__ 找到."

msgid "StereoEnhance"
msgstr "身歷聲增強(StereoEnhance)"

#, fuzzy
msgid "This effect uses a few algorithms to enhance a signal's stereo width."
msgstr "這種效果使用一些演算法來增強訊號的身歷聲頻譜."

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻譯狀態"
