#: ../../docs/contributing/development/debugging/using_cpp_profilers.rst:28
msgid "To get useful profiling information, it is **absolutely required** to use a Godot build that includes debugging symbols. Official binaries do not include debugging symbols, since these would make the download size significantly larger."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is possible to run a profiler on less optimized builds (e.g. ``target=template_debug`` without LTO), but results will naturally be less representative of real world conditions."

msgid "Do *not* strip debugging symbols on the binaries using the ``strip`` command after compiling the binaries. Otherwise, you will no longer get useful profiling information when running a profiler."

msgid "If you're looking into optimizing Godot's startup/shutdown performance, you can tell the profiler to use the ``--quit`` command line option on the Godot binary. This will exit Godot just after it finished starting. The ``--quit`` option works with ``--editor``, ``--project-manager`` or ``--path <path to project directory>`` (which runs a project directly)."
