msgid "Bisecting is a way to find regressions in software. After reporting a bug on the `Godot repository on GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`__, you may be asked by a contributor to *bisect* the issue. Bisecting makes it possible for contributors to fix bugs faster, as they can know in advance which commit caused the regression. Your effort will be widely appreciated :)"

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/contributing/workflow/bisecting_regressions.rst:19
msgid "Godot developers use the `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ version control system. In the context of Git, bisecting is the process of performing a manual `binary search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm>`__ to determine when a regression appeared. While it's typically used for bugs, it can also be used to find other kinds of unexpected changes such as performance regressions."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/contributing/workflow/bisecting_regressions.rst:29
msgid "Before using Git's ``bisect`` command, we strongly recommend trying to reproduce the bug with an older (or newer) official release. This greatly reduces the range of commits that potentially need to be built from source and tested. You can find binaries of official releases, as well as alphas, betas, and release candidates `here <https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/>`__."

msgid "If you have experience with Godot 3.x and can reproduce an issue with Godot 4.0, we recommend trying to reproduce the issue in the latest Godot 3.x version (if the feature exhibiting the bug is present in 3.x). This can be used to check whether the issue is a regression in 4.0 or not."

msgid "Going from the oldest to the newest build generally reduces the risk of the project not being able to successfully open in the editor, thanks to backwards compatibility. Try to reduce your project to the smallest repeatable example too. The more minimal the project is, the more likely you'll be able to open it without compatibility issues in newer engine versions."

msgid "If you've found a build that didn't exhibit the bug in the above testing process, you can now start bisecting the regression. The Git version control system offers a built-in command for this: ``git bisect``. This makes the process semi-automated as you only have to build the engine, run it and try to reproduce the bug."

msgid "Note that compiling Godot can take a while on slow hardware (up an hour for each full rebuild on a slow dual-core CPU). This means the full process can take up to several hours. If your hardware is too slow, you may want to stop there and report the results of your \"pre-bisecting\" on the GitHub issue so another contributor can continue bisecting from there."

If you're using a pre-release build as the \"good\" or \"bad\" build, browse the `download mirror <https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/>`__, go to the folder that contains the pre-release you downloaded and look for the ``README.txt`` file.
