msgid "When a generic type parameter is annotated with the ``[MustBeVariant]`` attribute, the generic type is required to be a Variant-compatible type. When the type used is also a generic type, this generic type must be annotated with the ``[MustBeVariant]`` attribute as well. For example, the generic ``Godot.Collections.Array<T>`` type only supports items of a type that can be converted to Variant, a generic type can be specified if it's properly annotated."
