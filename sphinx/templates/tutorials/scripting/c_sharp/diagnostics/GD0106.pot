msgid "Godot doesn't allow exporting explicit interface property implementations. When an interface member is implemented explicitly, the member is hidden and consumers can't access them unless the type is converted to the interface first. Explicitly implemented members can also share the same name of other members in the type, so it could create naming conflicts with other exported members."
