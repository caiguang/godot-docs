msgid "The main difference between the `.NET collections <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/collections/>`_ and the Godot collections is that the .NET collections are implemented in C# while the Godot collections are implemented in C++ and the Godot C# API is a wrapper over it, this is an important distinction since it means every operation on a Godot collection requires marshaling which can be expensive especially inside a loop."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_collections.rst:19
msgid "Due to the performance implications, using Godot collections is only recommended when absolutely necessary (such as interacting with the Godot API). Godot only understands its own collection types, so it's required to use them when talking to the engine."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_collections.rst:29
msgid "It's also possible to convert between .NET collections and Godot collections. The Godot collections contain constructors from generic .NET collection interfaces that copy their elements, and the Godot collections can be used with the `LINQ <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/linq>`_ ``ToList``, ``ToArray`` and ``ToDictionary`` methods. But keep in mind this conversion requires marshaling every element in the collection and copies it to a new collection so it can be expensive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_collections.rst:37
msgid "Despite this, the Godot collections are optimized to try and avoid unnecessary marshaling, so methods like ``Sort`` or ``Reverse`` are implemented with a single interop call and don't need to marshal every element. Keep an eye out for generic APIs that take collection interfaces like `LINQ <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/linq>`_ because every method requires iterating the collection and, therefore, marshaling every element. Prefer using the instance methods of the Godot collections when possible."
