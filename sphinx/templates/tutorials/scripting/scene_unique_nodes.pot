msgid "Using ``get_node()`` to reference nodes from a script can sometimes be fragile. If you move a button in a UI scene from one panel to another, the button's node path changes, and if a script uses ``get_node()`` with a hard-coded node path, the script will not be able to find the button anymore."

msgid "If a script has access to a node in another scene, it can call ``get_node()`` on that node to get scene unique nodes from that node's scene.

msgid ":ref:`Node.find_child() <class_Node_method_find_child>` finds a node by name without knowing its full path. This seems similar to a scene unique node, but this method is able to find nodes in nested scenes, and doesn't require marking the node in the scene editor in any way. However, this method is slow. Scene unique nodes are cached by Godot and are fast to retrieve, but each time the method is called, ``find_child()`` needs to check every descendant (every child, grandchild, and so on)."
