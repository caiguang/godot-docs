msgid "This, translated to reality, means that Godot used with GDScript is a combination designed to create games quickly and efficiently. For games that are very computationally intensive and can't benefit from the engine built-in tools (such as the Vector types, Physics Engine, Math library, etc), the possibility of using C++ is present too. This allows you to still create most of the game in GDScript and add small bits of C++ in the areas that need a performance boost."

msgid "This way, everything that can be smashed by a rock would have to inherit Smashable. If a character, enemy, piece of furniture, small rock were all smashable, they would need to inherit from the class Smashable, possibly requiring multiple inheritance. If multiple inheritance was undesired, then they would have to inherit a common class like Entity. Yet, it would not be very elegant to add a virtual method ``smash()`` to Entity only if a few of them can be smashed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_advanced.rst:493

msgid "And that's it. If the object that hit the big rock has a smash() method, it will be called. No need for inheritance or polymorphism. Dynamically typed languages only care about the instance having the desired method or member, not what it inherits or the class type. The definition of Duck Typing should make this clearer:"
