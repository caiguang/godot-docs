msgid "Godot offers a feature to automatically load nodes at the root of your project, allowing you to access them globally, that can fulfill the role of a Singleton: :ref:`doc_singletons_autoload`. These autoloaded nodes are not freed when you change the scene from code with :ref:`SceneTree.change_scene_to_file <class_SceneTree_method_change_scene_to_file>`."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:17
msgid "Other engines can encourage the use of creating manager classes, singletons that organize a lot of functionality into a globally accessible object. Godot offers many ways to avoid global state thanks to the node tree and signals."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:21
msgid "For example, let's say we are building a platformer and want to collect coins that play a sound effect. There's a node for that: the :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer <class_AudioStreamPlayer>`. But if we call the ``AudioStreamPlayer`` while it is already playing a sound, the new sound interrupts the first."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:26
msgid "A solution is to code a global, autoloaded sound manager class. It generates a pool of ``AudioStreamPlayer`` nodes that cycle through as each new request for sound effects comes in. Say we call that class ``Sound``, you can use it from anywhere in your project by calling ``Sound.play(\"coin_pickup.ogg\")``. This solves the problem in the short term but causes more problems:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:32
msgid "**Global state**: one object is now responsible for all objects' data. If the ``Sound`` class has errors or doesn't have an AudioStreamPlayer available, all the nodes calling it can break."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:36
msgid "**Global access**: now that any object can call ``Sound.play(sound_path)`` from anywhere, there's no longer an easy way to find the source of a bug."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:39
msgid "**Global resource allocation**: with a pool of ``AudioStreamPlayer`` nodes stored from the start, you can either have too few and face bugs, or too many and use more memory than you need."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:45
msgid "About global access, the problem is that any code anywhere could pass wrong data to the ``Sound`` autoload in our example. As a result, the domain to explore to fix the bug spans the entire project."

msgid "When you keep code inside a scene, only one or two scripts may be involved in audio."

msgid "Contrast this with each scene keeping as many ``AudioStreamPlayer`` nodes as it needs within itself and all these problems go away:"

msgid "Each scene manages its own state information. If there is a problem with the data, it will only cause issues in that one scene."

msgid "Another reason to use an Autoload can be that you want to reuse the same method or data across many scenes."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the case of functions, you can create a new type of ``Node`` that provides that feature for an individual scene using the :ref:`class_name <doc_gdscript_basics_class_name>` keyword in GDScript."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:83
msgid "GDScript supports the creation of ``static`` functions using ``static func``. When combined with ``class_name``, this makes it possible to create libraries of helper functions without having to create an instance to call them. The limitation of static functions is that they can't reference member variables, non-static functions or ``self``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:89
msgid "Since Godot 4.1, GDScript also supports ``static`` variables using ``static var``. This means you can now share a variables across instances of a class without having to create a separate autoload."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:93
msgid "Still, autoloaded nodes can simplify your code for systems with a wide scope. If the autoload is managing its own information and not invading the data of other objects, then it's a great way to create systems that handle broad-scoped tasks. For example, a quest or a dialogue system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:100
msgid "An autoload is *not* necessarily a singleton. Nothing prevents you from instantiating copies of an autoloaded node. An autoload is only a tool that makes a node load automatically as a child of the root of your scene tree, regardless of your game's node structure or which scene you run, e.g. by pressing the :kbd:`F6` key."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/best_practices/autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.rst:106
msgid "As a result, you can get the autoloaded node, for example an autoload called ``Sound``, by calling ``get_node(\"/root/Sound\")``."
