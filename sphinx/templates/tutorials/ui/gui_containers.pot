msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_containers.rst:13
msgid "This is often the case of games, such as RPGs, online chats, tycoons or simulations. Another common case where more advanced layout features may be required is in-game tools (or simply just tools)."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_containers.rst:16
msgid "All these situations require a more capable OS-like user interface, with advanced layout and formatting. For that, :ref:`Containers <class_container>` are more useful."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_containers.rst:26
msgid "When a :ref:`Container <class_Container>`-derived node is used, all children :ref:`Control <class_Control>` nodes give up their own positioning ability. This means the *Container* will control their positioning and any attempt to manually alter these nodes will be either ignored or invalidated the next time their parent is resized."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_containers.rst:30
msgid "Likewise, when a *Container* derived node is resized, all its children will be re-positioned according to it, with a behavior based on the type of container used:"

msgid "Sizing options"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_containers.rst:42
msgid "When adding a node to a container, the way the container treats each child depends mainly on their *container sizing options*. These options can be found by inspecting the layout of any *Control* that is a child of a *Container*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_containers.rst:47
msgid "Sizing options are independent for vertical and horizontal sizing and not all containers make use of them (but most do):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_containers.rst:49
msgid "**Fill**: Ensures the control *fills* the designated area within the container. No matter if a control *expands* or not (see below), it will only *fill* the designated area when this is toggled on (it is by default)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/ui/gui_containers.rst:51
msgid "**Expand**: Attempts to use as much space as possible in the parent container (in each axis). Controls that don't expand will be pushed away by those that do. Between expanding controls, the amount of space they take from each other is determined by the *Stretch Ratio* (see below). This option is only available when the parent Container is of the right type, for example the *HBoxContainer* has this option for horizontal sizing."
