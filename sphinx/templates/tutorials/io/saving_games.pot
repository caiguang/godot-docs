msgid "Save games can be complicated. For example, it may be desirable to store information from multiple objects across multiple levels. Advanced save game systems should allow for additional information about an arbitrary number of objects. This will allow the save function to scale as the game grows more complex."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you're looking to save user configuration, you can use the :ref:`class_ConfigFile` class for this purpose."

msgid "You can see how saving and loading works in action using the `Saving and Loading (Serialization) demo project <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/blob/master/loading/serialization>`__."

msgid "Identify persistent objects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:28
msgid "Firstly, we should identify what objects we want to keep between game sessions and what information we want to keep from those objects. For this tutorial, we will use groups to mark and handle objects to be saved, but other methods are certainly possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:33
msgid "We will start by adding objects we wish to save to the \"Persist\" group. We can do this through either the GUI or script. Let's add the relevant nodes using the GUI:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:39
msgid "Once this is done, when we need to save the game, we can get all objects to save them and then tell them all to save with this script:"

msgid "Serializing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:61
msgid "The next step is to serialize the data. This makes it much easier to read from and store to disk. In this case, we're assuming each member of group Persist is an instanced node and thus has a path. GDScript has helper class :ref:`JSON<class_json>` to convert between dictionary and string, Our node needs to contain a save function that returns this data. The save function will look like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:122
msgid "This gives us a dictionary with the style ``{ \"variable_name\":value_of_variable }``, which will be useful when loading."

msgid "Saving and reading data"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:129
msgid "As covered in the :ref:`doc_filesystem` tutorial, we'll need to open a file so we can write to it or read from it. Now that we have a way to call our groups and get their relevant data, let's use the class :ref:`JSON<class_json>` to convert it into an easily stored string and store them in a file. Doing it this way ensures that each line is its own object, so we have an easy way to pull the data out of the file as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:205
msgid "Game saved! Now, to load, we'll read each line. Use the :ref:`parse<class_JSON_method_parse>` method to read the JSON string back to a dictionary, and then iterate over the dict to read our values. But we'll need to first create the object and we can use the filename and parent values to achieve that. Here is our load function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:318
msgid "Now we can save and load an arbitrary number of objects laid out almost anywhere across the scene tree! Each object can store different data depending on what it needs to save."

msgid "Some notes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:325
msgid "We have glossed over setting up the game state for loading. It's ultimately up to the project creator where much of this logic goes. This is often complicated and will need to be heavily customized based on the needs of the individual project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:330
msgid "Additionally, our implementation assumes no Persist objects are children of other Persist objects. Otherwise, invalid paths would be created. To accommodate nested Persist objects, consider saving objects in stages. Load parent objects first so they are available for the :ref:`add_child() <class_node_method_add_child>` call when child objects are loaded. You will also need a way to link children to parents as the :ref:`NodePath <class_nodepath>` will likely be invalid."

msgid "For simple game state, JSON may work and it generates human-readable files that are easy to debug."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:344
msgid "But JSON has many limitations. If you need to store more complex game state or a lot of it, :ref:`binary serialization<doc_binary_serialization_api>` may be a better approach."

msgid "Here are some important gotchas to know about when using JSON."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:353
msgid "**Filesize:** JSON stores data in text format, which is much larger than binary formats."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/saving_games.rst:355
msgid "**Data types:** JSON only offers a limited set of data types. If you have data types that JSON doesn't have, you will need to translate your data to and from types that JSON can handle. For example, some important types that JSON can't parse are: ``Vector2``, ``Vector3``, ``Color``, ``Rect2``, and ``Quaternion``."

msgid "Note that not all properties are included. Only properties that are configured with the :ref:`PROPERTY_USAGE_STORAGE<class_@GlobalScope_constant_PROPERTY_USAGE_STORAGE>` flag set will be serialized. You can add a new usage flag to a property by overriding the :ref:`_get_property_list<class_Object_private_method__get_property_list>` method in your class. You can also check how property usage is configured by calling ``Object._get_property_list``. See :ref:`PropertyUsageFlags<enum_@GlobalScope_PropertyUsageFlags>` for the possible usage flags."
