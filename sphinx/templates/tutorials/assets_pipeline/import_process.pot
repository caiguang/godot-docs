msgid "**For any file type:** Copy files manually with your operating system's file manager."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:13
msgid "**For file types that can be imported by Godot:** Drag-and-drop files from the operating system's file manager to the editor's FileSystem dock. This only works with *resource* file types (i.e. file types that Godot can import)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:17
msgid "Godot will automatically import these files internally and keep the imported resources hidden in a ``res://.godot/imported/`` folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:20
msgid "This means that when trying to access imported assets through code, you need to use the :ref:`Resource Loader<class_ResourceLoader>` as it will automatically take into account where the internal files are saved. If you try and access an imported asset using the :ref:`FileAccess <class_FileAccess>` class, it will work in the editor, but **it will break in the exported project**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:26
msgid "However, the :ref:`Resource Loader<class_ResourceLoader>` cannot access non-imported files. Only the :ref:`FileAccess <class_FileAccess>` class can."

msgid "Import parameters are only present in *non-native* Godot resource types. This means Godot's own scene and resource file formats (``.tscn``, ``.scn``, ``.tres``, ``.res``) don't have import options you can select in the Import dock."

msgid "After adjusting the parameters, click **Reimport**. Be careful: if you select another file in the FileSystem dock before clicking **Reimport**, changes will be discarded. After clicking **Reimport**, the chosen parameters will only be used for this asset and on future reimports."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:49
msgid "Changing the import parameters of several assets at the same time is also possible. Simply select all of them together in the resources dock and the exposed parameters will apply to all of them when reimporting."

msgid "While working on a project you may find that several assets need to have the same parameters changed, such as enabling mipmaps, but you only want those specific parameters changed. To do this, select every asset you want to reimport in the file system. In the import tab there will now be a checkbox to the left of every import parameter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:64

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.rst:101
msgid "If any of the files present in this folder is erased (or the whole folder), the asset or assets will be reimported automatically. As such, committing the ``.godot/`` folder to the version control system is not recommended. While committing this folder can shorten reimporting time when checking out on another computer, it requires considerably more space and bandwidth."
