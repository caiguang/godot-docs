msgid "Godot :ref:`loosely follows <doc_release_policy>` a semantic versioning system, where compatibility is assumed between minor and patch releases, while major releases can break it. As such, it is generally not recommended to move projects between major versions during their development, especially if you've been working on them for a significant amount of time."
