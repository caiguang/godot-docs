msgid "The events placed on the call method track are not executed when the animation is previewed in the editor for safety."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_track_types.rst:46
msgid "To create such a track, click \"Add Track -> Call Method Track.\" Then, a window opens and lets you select the node to associate with the track. To call one of the node's methods, right-click the timeline and select \"Insert Key\". A window opens with a list of available methods. Double-click one to finish creating the keyframe."
