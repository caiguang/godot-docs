msgid "Godot has an action map feature as part of the XR system. At this point in time this system is part of the OpenXR module. There are plans to encompass WebXR into this in the near future hence we call it the XR action map system in this document. It implements the built-in action map system of OpenXR mostly exactly as it is offered."

msgid "Godot's built-in input system has many things in common with the XR action map system. In fact our original idea was to add functionality to the existing input system and expose the data to the OpenXR action map system. We may revisit that idea at some point but as it turns out there were just too many problems to overcome. To name a few:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/xr/xr_action_map.rst:28
msgid "Godot's input system mainly centers around button inputs, XR adds triggers, axis, poses and haptics (output) into the mix. This would greatly complicate the input system with features that won't work for normal controllers or contrast with the current approach. It was felt this would lead to confusion for the majority of Godot users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/xr/xr_action_map.rst:31
msgid "Godot's input system works with raw input data that is parsed and triggers emitting actions. This input data is made available to the end user. OpenXR completely hides raw data and does all the parsing for us, we only get access to already parsed action data. This inconsistency is likely to lead to bugs when an unsuspecting user tries to use an XR device as a normal input device."

msgid "This default map was designed to help developers port their XR games/applications from Godot 3 to Godot 4. As a result this map essentially binds all known inputs on all controllers supported by default, to actions one on one. This is not a good example of setting up an action map. It does allow a new developer to have a starting point when they want to become familiar with Godot XR. It prevents having to design a proper action map for their game/application first."

msgid "Due to the simple controller likely not covering the needs of your game, it is tempting to provide bindings for every controller supported by OpenXR. The default action map seems to suggest this as a valid course of action. As mentioned before, the default action map was designed for ease of migration from Godot 3."

msgid "It is the recommendation from the OpenXR Working Group that only bindings for controllers actually tested by the developer are setup. The XR runtimes are designed with this in mind. They can perform a better job of rebinding a provided binding than a developer can make educated guesses. Especially as the developer can't test if this leads to a comfortable experience for the end user."

msgid "This is our advice as well: limit your action map to the interaction profiles for devices you have actually tested your game with. The Oculus Touch controller is widely used as a fallback controller by many runtimes. If you are able to test your game using a Meta Rift or Quest and add this profile there is a high probability your game will work with other headsets."
