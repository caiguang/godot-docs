msgid "Due to their limited resolution, scenes rendered in 2D can exhibit aliasing artifacts. These artifacts usually manifest in the form of a \"staircase\" effect on geometry edges, and are most noticeable when using nodes such as :ref:`class_Line2D`, :ref:`class_Polygon2D` or :ref:`class_TextureProgressBar`. :ref:`doc_custom_drawing_in_2d` can also have aliasing artifacts for methods that don't support antialiasing."

msgid "Line2D has an **Antialiased** property which you can enable in the inspector. Also, several methods for :ref:`doc_custom_drawing_in_2d` support an optional ``antialiased`` parameter, which can be set to ``true`` when calling the function."

msgid "These methods do not require MSAA to be enabled, which makes their *baseline* performance cost low. In other words, there is no permanent added cost if you're not drawing any antialiased geometry at some point."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/2d/2d_antialiasing.rst:49
msgid "The downside of these antialiasing methods is that they work by generating additional geometry. If you're generating complex 2D geometry that's updated every frame, this may be a bottleneck. Also, Polygon2D, TextureProgressBar, and several custom drawing methods don't feature an antialiased property. For these nodes, you can use 2D multisample antialiasing instead."

msgid "Before enabling MSAA in 2D, it's important to understand what MSAA will operate on. MSAA in 2D follows similar restrictions as in 3D. While it does not introduce any blurriness, its scope of application is limited. The main applications of 2D MSAA are:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/2d/2d_antialiasing.rst:68
msgid "The downside of MSAA is that it only operates on edges. This is because MSAA increases the number of *coverage* samples, but not the number of *color* samples. However, since the number of color samples did not increase, fragment shaders are still run for each pixel only once. As a result, MSAA will **not affect** the following kinds of aliasing in any way:"
