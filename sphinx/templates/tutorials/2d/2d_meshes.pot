msgid "In 3D, meshes are used to display the world. In 2D, they are rare as images are used more often. Godot's 2D engine is a pure two-dimensional engine, so it can't really display 3D meshes directly (although it can be done via ``Viewport`` and ``ViewportTexture``)."

msgid "2D meshes are meshes that contain two-dimensional geometry (Z can be omitted or ignored) instead of 3D. You can experiment creating them yourself using ``SurfaceTool`` from code and displaying them in a ``MeshInstance2D`` node."

msgid "This workflow is useful for optimizing 2D drawing in some situations. When drawing large images with transparency, Godot will draw the whole quad to the screen. The large transparent areas will still be drawn."

msgid "This can affect performance, especially on mobile devices, when drawing very large images (generally screen sized), or layering multiple images on top of each other with large transparent areas (for example, when using ``ParallaxBackground``)."
