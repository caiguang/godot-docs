msgid "Historically, level of detail in 3D games involved manually authoring meshes with lower geometry density, then configuring the distance thresholds at which these lower-detailed meshes should be drawn. This approach is still used today when increased control is needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/mesh_lod.rst:29
msgid "However, in projects that have a large amount of detailed 3D assets, setting up LOD manually can be a very time-consuming process. As a result, automatic mesh decimation and LOD configuration is becoming increasingly popular."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/mesh_lod.rst:33
msgid "Godot provides a way to automatically generate less detailed meshes for LOD usage on import, then use those LOD meshes when needed automatically. This is completely transparent to the user. The `meshoptimizer <https://meshoptimizer.org/>`__ library is used for LOD mesh generation behind the scenes."

msgid "By default, mesh LOD generation happens automatically for imported 3D scenes (glTF, .blend, Collada, FBX). Once LOD meshes are generated, they will automatically be used when rendering the scene. You don't need to configure anything manually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/mesh_lod.rst:75
msgid "However, mesh LOD generation does **not** automatically happen for imported 3D meshes (OBJ). This is because OBJ files are not imported as full 3D scenes by default, but only as individual mesh resources to load into a MeshInstance3D node (or GPUParticles3D, CPUParticles3D, ...)."

msgid "If you need to perform per-object adjustments to mesh LOD, you can adjust how aggressive LOD transitions should be by adjusting the **LOD Bias** property on any node that inherits from GeometryInstance3D. Values *above* ``1.0`` will make LOD transitions happen later than usual (resulting in higher quality but lower performance). Values *below* ``1.0`` will make LOD transitions happen sooner than usual (resulting in lower quality but higher performance)."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/mesh_lod.rst:167
msgid "When rendering the scene, mesh LOD selection uses a screen-space metric. This means it automatically takes camera field of view and viewport resolution into account. Higher camera FOV and lower viewport resolutions will make LOD selection more aggressive; the engine will display heavily decimated models earlier when the camera moves away."

msgid "For LOD selection, the point of the node's :abbr:`AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)` that is the closest to the camera is used as a basis. This applies to any kind of mesh LOD (including for individual MeshInstance3D)s, but this has some implications for nodes that display multiple meshes at once, such as MultiMeshInstance3D, GPUParticles3D and GPUParticles3D. Most importantly, this means that all instances will be drawn with the same LOD level at a given time."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/mesh_lod.rst:192
msgid "If you have instances in a MultiMesh that are far away from each other, they should be placed in a separate MultiMeshInstance3D node. Doing so will also improve rendering performance, as frustum and occlusion culling will be able to cull individual nodes (while they can't cull individual instances in a MultiMesh)."
