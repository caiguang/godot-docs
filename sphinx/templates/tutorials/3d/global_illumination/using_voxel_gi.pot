This file must be saved with a ``.res`` (binary resource) extension instead of ``.tres`` (text-based resource).

msgid "**Normal Bias:** Similar to **Bias**, but offsets the lookup into the voxel buffer by the surface normal. This also helps avoid self-occlusion artifacts. Higher values reduce self-reflections visible in non-rough materials, at the cost of more visible light leaking and flatter-looking indirect lighting. To prioritize hiding self-reflections over lighting quality, set **Bias** to ``0.0`` and **Normal Bias** to a value between ``1.0`` and ``2.0``."

msgid "**Gi > Use Half Resolution:** If enabled, both VoxelGI and SDFGI will have their GI buffer rendering at halved resolution. For instance, when rendering in 3840×2160, the GI buffer will be computed at a 1920×1080 resolution.

msgid "To combat light leaking with thin geometry, it's recommended to make the geometry in question thicker. If this is not possible, then add a primitive MeshInstance3D node with its global illumination mode set to **Static**. Bake VoxelGI again, then hide the primitive MeshInstance3D node (it will still be taken into account by VoxelGI). For optimal results, the MeshInstance3D should have a material whose color matches the original thin geometry."

msgid "If you notice VoxelGI nodes popping in and out of existence as the camera moves, this is most likely because the engine is rendering too many VoxelGI instances at once. Godot is limited to rendering 8 VoxelGI nodes at once, which means up to 8 instances can be in the camera view before some of them will start flickering."
