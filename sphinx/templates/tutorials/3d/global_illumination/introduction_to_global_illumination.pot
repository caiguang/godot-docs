msgid "*Global illumination* is a catch-all term used to describe a system of lighting that uses both direct light (light that comes directly from a light source) and indirect light (light that bounces from a surface). In a 3D rendering engine, global illumination is one of the most important elements to achieving realistic lighting. Global illumination aims to mimic how light behaves in real life, such as light bouncing on surfaces and light being emitted from emissive materials."

msgid "In the example below, the entire scene is illuminated by an emissive material (the white square at the top). The white wall and ceiling on the back is tinted red and green close to the walls, as the light bouncing on the colored walls is being reflected back onto the rest of the scene."

msgid "Light *bouncing* on surfaces. This bounced lighting is multiplied with the material's albedo color. The bounced lighting can then be reflected by other surfaces, with decreasing impact due to light attenuation. In real life, light bounces an infinite number of times. However, for performance reasons, this can't be simulated in a game engine. Instead, the number of bounces is typically limited to 1 or 2 (or up to 16 when baking lightmaps). A greater number of bounces will lead to more realistic light falloff in shaded areas, at the cost of lower performance or greater bake times."
