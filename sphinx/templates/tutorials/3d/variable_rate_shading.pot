msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/variable_rate_shading.rst:9
msgid "In modern 3D rendering engines, shaders are much more complex compared to before. The advent of physically-based rendering, real-time global illumination and screen-space effects has increased the number of *per-pixel* shading that must be performed to render each frame. Additionally, screen resolutions also have increased a lot, with 1440p and 4K now being common target resolutions. As a result, the total shading cost in scene rendering usually represents a significant amount of the time taken to render each frame."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/variable_rate_shading.rst:17
msgid "Variable rate shading (VRS) is a method of decreasing this shading cost by reducing the resolution of *per-pixel* shading (also called *fragment* shading), while keeping the original resolution for rendering geometry. This means geometry edges remain as sharp as they would without VRS. VRS can be combined with any :ref:`doc_3d_antialiasing` technique (MSAA, FXAA, TAA, SSAA)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/variable_rate_shading.rst:23
msgid "VRS allows specifying the shading quality in a local manner, which makes it possible to have certain parts of the viewport receive more detailed shading than others. This is particularly useful in virtual reality (VR) to achieve *foveated rendering*, where the center of the viewport is more detailed than the edges."

However, there is no benefit to using a VRS density map that is larger than the viewport resolution divided by the GPU's *tile size*. The tile size is what determines the smallest area of pixels where the shading density can be changed separately from other tiles. On most GPUs, this tile size is 8×8 pixels. You can view the tile size by running Godot with the ``--verbose`` command line argument, as it's printed in the VRS debugging information."
