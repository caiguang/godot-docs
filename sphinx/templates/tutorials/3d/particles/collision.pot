msgid "Since GPU particles are processed entirely on the GPU, they don't have access to the game's physical world. If you need particles to collide with the environment, you have to set up particle collision nodes. There are four of them: :ref:`class_GPUParticlesCollisionBox3D`, :ref:`class_GPUParticlesCollisionSphere3D`, :ref:`class_GPUParticlesCollisionSDF3D`, and :ref:`class_GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D`."

Box extents always measure half of the sides of its bounds, so a value of ``(X=1.0,Y=1.0,Z=1.0)`` creates a box that is 2 meters wide on each side.

msgid "Height field particle collision is very useful for large outdoor areas that need to collide with particles. At runtime, the node creates a height field from all the meshes within its bounds that match its cull mask. Particles collide against the mesh that this height field represents. Since the height field generation is done dynamically, it can follow the player camera around and react to changes in the level. Different settings for the height field density offer a wide range of performance adjustments."

If you need particles to collide with dynamic objects that change position frequently, you can select ``Always`` to refresh every frame. This comes with a cost to performance and should only be used when necessary."

msgid "SDF collision nodes create a `signed distance field <https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/k2zbos/eli5_what_are_distance_fields_in_graphics>`_ that particles can collide with. SDF collision is similar to height field collision in that it turns multiple meshes within its bounds into a single collision volume for particles. A major difference is that signed distance fields can represent holes, tunnels and overhangs, which is impossible to do with height fields alone. The performance overhead is larger compared to height fields, so they're best suited for small-to-medium-sized environments."

SDF collision nodes have to be baked in order to have any effect on particles in the level. To do that, click the ``Bake SDF`` button in the viewport toolbar while the SDF collision node is selected and choose a directory to store the baked data. Since SDF collision needs to be baked in the editor, it's static and cannot change at runtime."
