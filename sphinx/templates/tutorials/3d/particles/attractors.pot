msgid "Particle attractors are nodes that apply a force to all particles within their reach. They pull particles closer or push them away based on the direction of that force. There are three types of attractors: :ref:`class_GPUParticlesAttractorBox3D`, :ref:`class_GPUParticlesAttractorSphere3D`, and :ref:`class_GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D`. You can instantiate them at runtime and change their properties from gameplay code; you can even animate and combine them for complex attraction effects."

msgid "``Attenuation`` controls the strength falloff within the attractor's influence region. Every particle attractor has a boundary. Its strength is weakest at the border of this boundary and strongest at its center. Particles outside of the boundary are not affected by the attractor at all. The attenuation curve controls how the strength weakens over that distance. A straight line means that the strength is proportional to the distance: if a particle is halfway between the boundary and the center, the attractor strength will be half of what it is at the center. Different curve shapes change how fast particles accelerate towards the attractor."

msgid "The ``Directionality`` property changes the direction towards which particles are pulled. At a value of ``0.0``, there is no directionality, which means that particles are pulled towards the attractor's center. At ``1.0``, the attractor is fully directional, which means particles will be pulled along the attractor's local ``-Z``-axis. You can change the global direction by rotating the attractor. If ``Strength`` is negative, particles are instead pulled along the ``+Z``-axis."

Since particles can move in two directions along each axis, the lower half of the color range represents negative direction values while the upper half represents positive direction values.
