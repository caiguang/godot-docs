msgid "To get started with particles, the first thing we need to do is add a ``GPUParticles3D`` node to the scene. Before we can actually see any particles, we have to set up two parameters on the node: the ``Process Material`` and at least one ``Draw Pass``."

msgid ":ref:`class_ParticleProcessMaterial` is a special kind of material. We don't use it to draw any objects. We use it to update particle data and behavior on the GPU instead of the CPU, which comes with a massive performance boost. A click on the newly added material displays a long list of properties that you can set to control each particle's behavior."

msgid "In order to render any particles, at least one draw pass needs to be defined. To do that, go to ``Draw Passes`` in the inspector panel. Click on the box next to ``Pass 1`` and select ``New QuadMesh`` from the dropdown menu. After that, click on the mesh and set its ``Size`` to 0.1 for both ``x`` and ``y``. Reducing the mesh's size makes it a little easier to tell the individual particle meshes apart at this stage."

msgid "You can use up to 4 draw passes per particle system. Each pass can render a different mesh with its own unique material. All draw passes use the data that is computed by the process material, which is an efficient method for composing complex effects: Compute particle behavior once and feed it to multiple render passes."

msgid "If you followed the steps above, your particle system should now be emitting particles in a waterfall-like fashion, making them move downwards and disappear after a few seconds. This is the foundation for all particle effects. Take a look at the documentation for :ref:`particle <doc_3d_particles_properties>` and :ref:`particle material <doc_process_material_properties>` properties to learn how to make particle effects more interesting."
