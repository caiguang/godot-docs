msgid "Sometimes, the fastest way to add texture detail to a scene is to use decals. This is especially the case for organic detail, such as patches of dirt or sand scattered on a large surface. Decals can help break up texture repetition in scenes and make patterns look more natural. On a smaller scale, decals can also be used to create detail variations for objects. For example, decals can be used to add nuts and bolts on top of hard-surface geometry."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:72
msgid "Blob shadows are frequently used in mobile projects (or to follow a retro art style), as real-time lighting tends to be too expensive on low-end mobile devices. However, when relying on baked lightmaps with fully baked lights, dynamic objects will not cast *any* shadow from those lights. This makes dynamic objects in lightmapped scenes look flat in comparison to real-time lighting, with dynamic objects almost looking like they're floating."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:79
msgid "Thanks to blob shadows, dynamic objects can still cast an approximative shadow. Not only this helps with depth perception in the scene, but this can also be a gameplay element, especially in 3D platformers. The blob shadow's length can be extended to let the player know where they will land if they fall straight down."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:84
msgid "Even with real-time lighting, blob shadows can still be useful as a form of ambient occlusion for situations where SSAO is too expensive or too unstable due to its screen-space nature. For example, vehicles' underside shadows are well-represented using blob shadows."

msgid "Move the Decal node towards an object, then rotate it so the decal is visible (and in the right orientation). If the decal appears mirrored, try to rotate it by 180 degrees. You can double-check whether it's in the right orientation by increasing **Parameters > Normal Fade** to 0.5. This will prevent the Decal from being projected on surfaces that are not facing the decal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:109
msgid "If your decal is meant to affect static objects only, configure it to prevent affecting dynamic objects (or vice versa). To do so, change the decal's **Cull Mask** property to exclude certain layers. After doing this, modify your dynamic objects' MeshInstance3D nodes to change their visibility layers. For instance, you can move them from layer 1 to layer 2, then disable layer 2 in the decal's **Cull Mask** property."

msgid "**Albedo:** The albedo (diffuse/color) map to use for the decal. In most situations, this is the texture you want to set first. If using a normal or ORM map, an albedo map *must* be set to provide an alpha channel. This alpha channel will be used as a mask to determine how much the normal/ORM maps will affect the underlying surface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:135
msgid "**ORM:** The Occlusion/Roughness/Metallic map to use for the decal. This is an optimized format for storing PBR material maps.

msgid "**Albedo Mix:** The opacity of the albedo texture. Unlike using an albedo texture with a more transparent alpha channel, decreasing this value below ``1.0`` does *not* reduce the impact of the normal/ORM texture on the underlying surface. Set this to ``0.0`` when creating normal/ORM-only decals such as footsteps or wet puddles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:155
msgid "**Normal Fade:** Fades the Decal if the angle between the Decal's :abbr:`AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)` and the target surface becomes too large. A value of ``0.0`` projects the decal regardless of angle, while a value of ``0.999`` limits the decal to surfaces that are nearly perpendicular. Setting **Normal Fade** to a value greater than ``0.0`` has a small performance cost due to the added normal angle computations."

Use this to reduce the number of active decals in a scene and thus improve performance."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:181
msgid "**Length:** The distance over which the decal fades (in 3D units). The decal becomes slowly more transparent over this distance and is completely invisible at the end. Higher values result in a smoother fade-out transition, which is more suited when the camera moves fast."

This is used so you can specify which types of objects receive the decal and which do not. This is especially useful so you can ensure that dynamic objects don't accidentally receive a Decal intended for the terrain under them."

msgid "Decal rendering performance is mostly determined by their screen coverage, but also their number. In general, a few large decals that cover up most of the screen will be more expensive to render than many small decals that are scattered around."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:203
msgid "To improve rendering performance, you can enable the **Distance Fade** property as described above. This will make distant decals fade out when they are far away from the camera (and may have little to no impact on the final scene rendering). Using node groups, you can also prevent non-essential decorative decals from spawning based on user configuration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:209
msgid "The way decals are rendered also has an impact on performance. The **Rendering > Textures > Decals > Filter** advanced project setting lets you control how decal textures should be filtered. **Nearest/Linear** does not use mipmaps. However, decals will look grainy at a distance. **Nearest/Linear Mipmaps** will look smoother at a distance, but decals will look blurry when viewed from oblique angles. This can be resolved by using **Nearest/Linear Mipmaps Anisotropic**, which provides the highest quality but is also slower to render."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:217
msgid "If your project has a pixel art style, consider setting the filter to one of the **Nearest** values so that decals use nearest-neighbor filtering. Otherwise, stick to **Linear**."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:227
msgid "For performance reasons, decals use purely fixed rendering logic. This means decals cannot use custom shaders. However, custom shaders on the projected surfaces are able to read the information that is overridden by decals on top of them, such as roughness and metallic."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_decals.rst:232
msgid "When using the Forward+ renderer, Godot uses a *clustering* approach for decal rendering. As many decals as desired can be added (as long as performance allows). However, there's still a default limit of 512 *clustered elements* that can be present in the current camera view. A clustered element is an omni light, a spot light, a :ref:`decal <doc_using_decals>` or a :ref:`reflection probe <doc_reflection_probes>`. This limit can be increased by adjusting the **Rendering > Limits > Cluster Builder > Max Clustered Elements** advanced project setting."
