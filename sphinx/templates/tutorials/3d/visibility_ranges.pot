msgid "How it works"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/visibility_ranges.rst:28
msgid "Visibility ranges can be used with any node that inherits from GeometryInstance3D. This means they can be used not only with MeshInstance3D and MultiMeshInstance3D for artist-controlled :abbr:`HLOD (Hierarchical Level of Detail)`, but also GPUParticles3D, CPUParticles3D, Label3D, Sprite3D, AnimatedSprite3D and CSGShape3D."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/visibility_ranges.rst:33
msgid "Since visibility ranges are configured on a per-node basis, this makes it possible to use different node types as part of a :abbr:`LOD (Level of Detail)` system. For example, you could display a MeshInstance3D representing a tree when up close, and replace it with a Sprite3D impostor in the distance to improve performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/visibility_ranges.rst:38
msgid "The benefit of :abbr:`HLOD (Hierarchical Level of Detail)` over a traditional :abbr:`LOD (Level of Detail)` system is its hierarchical nature. A single larger mesh can replace several smaller meshes, so that the number of draw calls can be reduced at a distance, but culling opportunities can be preserved when up close. For example, you can have a group of houses that uses individual MeshInstance3D nodes (one for each house) when up close, but turns into a single MeshInstance3D that represents a less detailed group of houses (or use a MultiMeshInstance3D)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/visibility_ranges.rst:46
msgid "Lastly, visibility ranges can also be used to fade certain objects entirely when the camera gets too close or too far. This can be used for gameplay purposes, but also to reduce visual clutter. For example, Label3D nodes can be faded using visibility ranges when they're too far away to be readable or relevant to the player."

After following this guide, this LOD system will display a SphereMesh when up close and a BoxMesh when the camera is far away enough. A small hysteresis margin is also configured via the **Begin Margin** and **End Margin** properties. This prevents LODs from popping back and forth too quickly when the camera is moving at the \"edge\" of the LOD transition."

msgid "**Disabled:** Uses hysteresis to switch between LOD levels instantly. This prevents situations where LOD levels are switched back and forth quickly when the player moves forward and then backward at the LOD transition point. The hystereis distance is determined by **Visibility Range > Begin Margin** and **Visibility Range > End Margin**. This mode provides the best performance as it doesn't force rendering to become transparent during the fade transition."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/visibility_ranges.rst:117
msgid "**Self:** Uses alpha blending to smoothly fade between LOD levels. The node will fade-out itself when reaching the limits of its own visibility range.

This mode forces transparent rendering on the object during its fade transition, so it has a performance impact."

This mode forces transparent rendering on the object during its fade transition, so it has a performance impact.

msgid "One way to further improve performance is to use simpler materials for distant LOD meshes. While using LOD meshes will reduce the number of vertices that need to be rendered, the per-pixel shading load for materials remains identical. However, per-pixel shading load is regularly a bottleneck on the GPU in complex 3D scenes. One way to reduce this shading load on the GPU is to use simpler materials when they don't make much of a visual difference."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/visibility_ranges.rst:206
msgid "Performance gains when doing so should be carefully measured, as increasing the number of *unique* materials in a scene has a performance cost on its own.
