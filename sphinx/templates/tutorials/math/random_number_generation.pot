msgid "After giving you a brief overview of useful functions that generate random numbers, you will learn how to get random elements from arrays, dictionaries, and how to use a noise generator in GDScript. Lastly, we'll take a look at cryptographically secure random number generation and how it differs from typical random number generation."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/random_number_generation.rst:44
msgid "Since Godot 4.0, the random seed is automatically set to a random value when the project starts. This means you don't need to call ``randomize()`` in ``_ready()`` anymore to ensure that results are random across project runs. However, you can still use ``randomize()`` if you want to use a specific seed number, or generate it using a different method."

msgid "In global scope, you can find a :ref:`randomize() <class_@GlobalScope_method_randomize>` method. **This method should be called only once when your project starts to initialize the random seed.** Calling it multiple times is unnecessary and may impact performance negatively."
