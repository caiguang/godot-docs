msgid "Typically, you would use bones and a :ref:`Skeleton3D <class_Skeleton3D>` to animate objects. However, bones are animated on the CPU and so you end having to calculate thousands of operations every frame and it becomes impossible to have thousands of objects. Using vertex animation in a vertex shader, you avoid using bones and can instead calculate the full animation in a few lines of code and completely on the GPU."

msgid "All the code for the animation will be in the vertex shader with uniforms controlling the amount of motion. We use uniforms to control the strength of the motion so that you can tweak the animation in editor and see the results in real time, without the shader having to recompile."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/performance/vertex_animation/animating_thousands_of_fish.rst:50
msgid "All the motions will be made using cosine waves applied to ``VERTEX`` in model space. We want the vertices to be in model space so that the motion is always relative to the orientation of the fish. For example, side-to-side will always move the fish back and forth in its left to right direction, instead of on the ``x`` axis in the world orientation."

msgstr ""

msgid "The next motion is a cosine wave that moves down the length of the fish. To make it move along the spine of the fish, we offset the input to ``cos`` by the position along the spine, which is the variable we defined above, ``body``."

msgid "In order to apply the mask to the twist, we use ``mix``. ``mix`` allows us to mix the vertex position between a fully rotated vertex and one that is not rotated. We need to use ``mix`` instead of multiplying ``mask`` by the rotated ``VERTEX`` because we are not adding the motion to the ``VERTEX`` we are replacing the ``VERTEX`` with the rotated version. If we multiplied that by ``mask``, we would shrink the fish."
