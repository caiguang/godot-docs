msgid "``NavigationPathQueryObjects`` can be used together with ``NavigationServer.query_path()`` to obtain a heavily **customized** navigation path including optional **meta data** about the path."

msgid "This requires more setup compared to obtaining a normal NavigationPath but lets you tailor the pathfinding and provided path data to the different needs of a project."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationpathqueryobjects.rst:12
msgid "NavigationPathQueryObjects consist of a pair of objects, a ``NavigationPathQueryParameters`` object holding the customization options for the query and a ``NavigationPathQueryResult`` that receives (regular) updates with the resulting path and meta data from the query."

msgid "2D and 3D versions of ``NavigationPathQueryParameters`` are available as :ref:`NavigationPathQueryParameters2D<class_NavigationPathQueryParameters2D>` and :ref:`NavigationPathQueryParameters3D<class_NavigationPathQueryParameters3D>` respectively."

msgid "While not a strict requirement, both objects are intended to be created once in advance, stored in a persistent variable for the agent and reused for every followup path query with updated parameters. This reuse avoids performance implications from frequent object creation if a project has a large quantity of simultaneous agents that regularly update their paths."
