msgid "A typical example for different area access in gameplay are doors that connect rooms with different navigation meshes and are not accessible by all actors all the time."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_different_actor_area_access.rst:11
msgid "Add a NavigationRegion at the door position. Add an appropriate navigation mesh the size of the door that can connect with the surrounding navigation meshes. In order to control access, enable / disable navigation layer bits so path queries that use the same navigation layer bits can find a path through the \"door\" navigation mesh."

msgid "The bitmask can act as a set of door keys or abilities and only actors with at least one matching and enabled bit layer in their pathfinding query will find a path through this region. See :ref:`doc_navigation_advanced_using_navigationlayers` for more information on how to work with navigation layers and the bitmask."

msgid "Prefer working with navigation layers in path queries whenever possible as enabling or disabling navigation layers on a region triggers a costly recalculation of the navigation map connections."
