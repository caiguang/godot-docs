msgid "Static obstacles act as hard do-not-cross boundaries for avoidance using agents, e.g. similar to physics collision but for avoidance."

msgid "Static obstacles can not change their position. They can only be warped to a new position and rebuild from scratch. Static obstacles as a result are ill-suited for usages where the position is changed every frame as the constant rebuild has a high performance cost."

msgid "Static obstacles that are warped to another position can not be predicted by agents. This creates the risk of getting agents stuck should a static obstacle be warped on top of agents."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationobstacles.rst:33
msgid "When the 2D avoidance is used in 3D the y-axis of Vector3 vertices is ignored. Instead, the global y-axis position of the obstacle is used as the elevation level. Agents will ignore static obstacles in 3D that are below or above them. This is automatically determined by global y-axis position of both obstacle and agent as the elevation level as well as their respective height properties."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationobstacles.rst:46
msgid "While both static and dynamic properties can be active at the same time on the same obstacle this is not recommended for performance. Ideally when an obstacle is moving the static vertices are removed and instead the radius activated. When the obstacle reaches the new final position it should gradually enlarge its radius to push all other agents away. With enough created save space around the obstacle it should add the static vertices again and remove the radius. This helps to avoid getting agents stuck in the suddenly appearing static obstacle when the rebuild static boundary is finished."

msgid "Similar to agents the obstacles can make use of the ``avoidance_layers`` bitmask. All agents with a matching bit on their own avoidance mask will avoid the obstacle."
