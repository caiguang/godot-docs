msgid "Navigation works independently from other engine parts like rendering or physics. Navigation meshes are the only things considered when doing pathfinding, e.g. visuals and collision shapes for example are completely ignored by the navigation system. If you need to take other data (like visuals for example) into account when doing pathfinding, you need to adapt your navigation meshes accordingly. The process of factoring in navigation restrictions in navigation meshes is commonly referred to as navigation mesh baking."

Some nodes with a lot of data can be very heavy and slow to parse at runtime, e.g. a TileMap has one or more polygons for every single used cell and TileMapLayer to parse. Nodes that hold meshes need to request the data from the RenderingServer stalling the rendering in the process."
