msgid "The same is true for multiple NavigationPolygon resources. As long as their outline points overlap exactly the NavigationServer will merge them. NavigationPolygon outlines must be from different NavigationPolygon resources to connect."

msgid "Overlapping or intersecting outlines on the same NavigationPolygon will fail the navigation mesh creation. Overlapping or intersecting outlines from different NavigationPolygons will often fail to create the navigation region edge connections on the NavigationServer and should be avoided."

msgid "Exactly means exactly for the vertex position merge. Small float errors that happen quite regularly with imported meshes will prevent a successful vertex merge."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_connecting_navmesh.rst:29
msgid "Alternatively navigation meshes are not merged but still considered as **connected** by the NavigationServer when their edges are nearly parallel and within distance to each other. The connection distance is defined by the  ``edge_connection_margin`` for each navigation map. In many cases navigation mesh edges cannot properly connect when they partly overlap. Better avoid any navigation mesh overlap at all time for a consistent merge behavior."
