msgid "These are common properties for a moving body. The ``target_velocity`` is a :ref:`3D vector <class_Vector3>` combining a speed with a direction. Here, we define it as a property because we want to update and reuse its value across frames."

msgid "Here, we're going to make all calculations using the ``_physics_process()`` virtual function. Like ``_process()``, it allows you to update the node every frame, but it's designed specifically for physics-related code like moving a kinematic or rigid body."

We want the vector's length to be consistent, and not move faster diagonally. To do so, we can call its ``normalized()`` method."

msgid "On the last line, we call ``CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide()`` which is a powerful method of the ``CharacterBody3D`` class that allows you to move a character smoothly.
