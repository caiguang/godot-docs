This can be handy for values that you want to be able to adjust just like a node's built-in properties. Click on the ``Player`` node and you'll see the property now appears in the \"Script Variables\" section of the Inspector.

msgid "We start by setting the ``velocity`` to ``(0, 0)`` - by default, the player should not be moving. Then we check each input and add/subtract from the ``velocity`` to obtain a total direction. For example, if you hold ``right`` and ``down`` at the same time, the resulting ``velocity`` vector will be ``(1, 1)``. In this case, since we're adding a horizontal and a vertical movement, the player would move *faster* diagonally than if it just moved horizontally."
