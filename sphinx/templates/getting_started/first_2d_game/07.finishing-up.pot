msgid "The default gray background is not very appealing, so let's change its color. One way to do this is to use a :ref:`ColorRect <class_ColorRect>` node. Make it the first node under ``Main`` so that it will be drawn behind the other nodes. ``ColorRect`` only has one property: ``Color``. Choose a color you like and select \"Layout\" -> \"Anchors Preset\" -> \"Full Rect\" either in the toolbar at the top of the viewport or in the inspector so that it covers the screen."

msgid "Sound and music can be the single most effective way to add appeal to the game experience. In your game's **art** folder, you have two sound files: \"House In a Forest Loop.ogg\" for background music, and \"gameover.wav\" for when the player loses."

msgid "Add two :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer <class_AudioStreamPlayer>` nodes as children of ``Main``. Name one of them ``Music`` and the other ``DeathSound``. On each one, click on the ``Stream`` property, select \"Load\", and choose the corresponding audio file."

msgid "Now would be a good time to add controller support if you have one available. Attach or pair your controller and then under each input action that you wish to add controller support for, click on the \"+\" button and press the corresponding button, d-pad, or stick direction that you want to map to the respective input action."
